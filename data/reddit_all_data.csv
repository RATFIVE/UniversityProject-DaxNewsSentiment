Numerous German motorcycle and car manufacturers developed, produced, and marketed economy cars in response to the Great Depression in the early 1930s. The economy cars in question were mostly motorcycle-powered microcars called cyclecars. They were deemed dangerous, underpowered, and impractical.  Daimler-Benz stepped up in an attempt to address a growing demand for practical and safe economy cars with more power. In 1931, it got to work developing a such car and three [120H](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52685097431_51e41d8c3b_b.jpg) (not a typo) prototypes were built. Jewish engineer and debunked 'Father of the Volkswagen' Josef Ganz was involved in the development as an independent suspension specialist.  It wasn’t until 1934 when Daimler-Benz put the 130H into production. It is the luxury brand’s first of three rear-engined passenger cars (H stands for Heckmotor, rear engine) and first economy car. Despite handling issues due to poor weight distribution, only a handful of the 130H were sold over the course of two years. The  production figures remains unknown.  The third rear-engined car, the Mercedes-Benz 170H, was essentially an updated 130H. However, far fewer 170Hs were sold than the 130H when the production was brought to an abrupt end. Daimler-Benz wasn’t alone; in 1936, all German motorcycle and car manufacturers were ordered to stop developing, producing, and marketing economy cars. The anti-competition move was to pave way for Porsche’s Volkswagen.  Shortly thereafter, Daimler-Benz was dragged into a joint venture with Porsche and Stuttgarter Karosseriewerk Reutter. Infant firm Porsche didn’t have the production capability, so Daimler-Benz was forced to use its factory to produce running chassis for several iterations of Porsche Type 60 prototypes. Prior to the joint venture, [early Type 60 prototypes](https://i.redd.it/t8eevpx6glfd1.jpeg) had a striking resemblance to the 130H.  OK, enough history for tonight. Good night, r/CuteWheels!

The Throne was only a murderous soul-sucking device once it was forced to be used to seal the Webway Breach. Prior to that, it was indeed the means by which Magnus would have been able to essentially astral project anywhere, explore the Webway and the universe with the Emperor and generally use his psychic powers to the best of his ability (and to the benefit of everyone). It was exactly what Magnus was promised from the start and he was 100% on board with it (though he didn't know the exact form it would take).  *Hollow Mountain* goes as far as showing detailed schematics of how Magnus would be using the Throne."", 'What Magnus thought the throne would be like  >The images in the glass changed once more, and Magnus saw the Golden Throne, its mechanisms wreathed in crackling arcs of lighting. A howling, withered cadaver sat upon the throne, its once-mighty flesh blackened and metastasised.  >“This is to be your destiny,” said the mirror, “bound forever to the Emperor’s soul-engine, suffering unendurable agony to serve his selfish desires. Look upon this and know the truth.”  >Magnus tried to look away, but the horror of the vision was impossible to ignore.  What Magnus came to realise it would be like  >Unspoken understanding flowed between Magnus and the Emperor. Everything Magnus had done was laid bare, and everything the Emperor planned flowed into him. He saw himself atop the Golden Throne, using his fearsome powers to guide humanity to its destiny as rulers of the galaxy. He was to be his father’s chosen instrument of ultimate victory. It broke him to know that his unthinking hubris had shattered that dream.   Magnus somehow forgot and had to realise it would be like again  >Back to the birthrock he flew, and there, deep in the heart of the world, Magnus found himself in the great cavern of machines, sat upon the same Golden Throne upon which he had so recently seen his father.  >Fear touched Magnus as he remembered seeing a vision of this, his physical body ravaged and husked out by the unimaginable cost of maintaining the portal.  >I have seen this, he said. It will kill me.  >+Look closer, my son.+  >The vast doors before the throne were open, and a beatific light issued from what lay beyond. This was not the vision of his doom he had been shown, for here his face was serene and vacant, merely a vessel of flesh and blood.

In that future, he is chained to the Golden Throne, thrashing and suffering for an eternity.   Tzeentch showed this to Magnus to *imply* that this was his fate if he goes back to the Emperor, and it's part of the reason why Magnus chooses to die at Prospero instead of surrendering to Russ, and one of the big reasons he fights against the Emperor when he is whole again.   However, it seems implied to me that this isn't a vission of the Emperor winning the Heresy and torturing Magnus, but rather a vision of *Horus* winning the Heresy and torturing him.   After all, it seems likely that Tzeentch can't just do whatever he likes in visions of the future, and more changing how they are framed and presented.   This is mostly headcannon and fan theory, nothing in the books that says that's whats up, but that's what's implied to me."", 'E is a huge blind spot for people, everyone always gotta neg the emperor', 'God, the dumbest thing big E ever did was not bringing Magnus back to Terra after Nikaea. Even in the absence of anything else, the crusade is nearly over and it would have been a good idea to keep an eye on Magnus.', 'Also important to note is that Malcador said that Magnus was originally intended to be a *contingency* for the Throne so that he (Malcador) wouldn’t have to sit on it and burn up in the event the Emperor couldn’t be on it.  So theoretically best case scenario;  Emperor and Malcador make the Throne. Emperor sits on it and maintains the Human Webway while helping Malcador with the paperwork.  Eventually the Emperor has to get off the Throne for some reason. He and Malcador came to that conclusion through pure logic, that at some point he *had* to get off the Throne.  Malcador wouldn’t survive for long, even if the Throne wasn’t a broken nuclear reactor. He probably would last longer on a working Throne, but would burn up all the same.  So when the Emperor would have to get off the Throne, Magnus would be able to get on while the Emperor does his Emperor business.  Alternatively Magnus and the Emperor would swap on and off on the Throne, so that way he can stretch his legs and Magnus can do his nerd shit on it.', 'Now I will imagine the Emporer during our time period living his best life as Big E from WWE.', "">I often hear words to the effect of “The Emperor planned to imprison/force/consign Magnus to The Golden Throne” and it is confirmed in the lore that Magnus would one day sit upon the throne.  I feel that you're misrepresenting what people are saying and why? Because some people do say that the Emperor was going to do that, yet only after Magnus warning broke the project. This is why the Emperor sent Russ, and Valdor to Prospero to arrest him and bring him to Terra and stick him on the Throne. This is why we see a giant primarch sized cage in Buried Dagger designed to hold Magnus. He was going imprisoned/forced/consigned to the Throne so they could fix the damage his sorcerous presence caused.  Magnus' role in the project is another topic entirely. Considering his key role in the future Imperium he should have been trained from the start. We know that the Emperor and Malcador only told one primarch the truth of Chaos and that it wasn't Magnus. Considering what he would have seen once he got on the Throne who know how he would have reacted when he saw the truth?"", 'Anyone that read ""Mechanicus"" could have told you that.']"

But with the potential of also out skilling an opponent and winning against the odds like clutching up a 1v4 or 1v5 is a crazy feeling, the type of feeling that you\'ll never get in PvE because you\'re playing against AI that have predictable behavior.  I don\'t care if someone plays PvE, it has zero impact on my gameplay anyway, and to be honest I\'d much rather someone go play PvE rather than buy RMT services and ruin my next 4 raids because they are tired of being shit on by Uber sweats and other RMT carries because the 3 other idiots in the lobby also paid for carry services, shit gets annoying real fucking quick.

This wipe I\'ve surprisingly noticed less RMTers going around. More so ""Knowers"" so to say, players who behave as if they have a little more information than they should.

518,1fo4un6,2024-09-24 07:06:34,Banken: Olaf Scholz kritisiert UniCredit-Aktienkäufe bei Commerzbank deutlich,94,All,Commerzbank,"[""Klapp' die Antworten auf diesen Kommentar auf, um zum Text des Artikels zu kommen."", '>""Deshalb hat sich die Bundesregierung in dieser Sache klar positioniert und macht sehr klar, dass wir das nicht für ein angemessenes Vorgehen halten in Europa und in Deutschland, dass man gewissermaßen ohne jede Kooperation, ohne jede Rücksprache, ohne jede Rückkoppelung versucht, mit unfreundlichen Methoden sich an Unternehmen aggressiv zu beteiligen.""  Meine Fresse Olaf! Das ist der Sinn und Zweck einer feindlichen Übernahme und das ist jetzt nicht die Erste in Europa. Und du bist Chef der Bundesregierung, die die Attacke erst mit ihrem stümperhaften Handeln möglich gemacht hast.', 'Ah, so eine feindliche Übernahme ist doch was feines. Gerade wenn die Regierung kalt erwischt wird und nicht stärker hinterfragt warum ein einzelner Investor das gesamte Paket für einen höheren Preis als alle anderen kaufen möchte. Ein Investor welcher schon vorher ankündigte ein Auge auf die Commerzbank geworfen zu haben.  [Edit: da die Frage aufkam mit kalt erwischt...ist zwar Bild aber hat einige Infos ](https://www.bild.de/geld/wirtschaft/krimi-um-commerzbank-wie-sich-die-regierung-vom-wichtigsten-banken-deal-des-jahres-ueberrumpeln-liess-66e5848b63176b30b5877e48) > Es ist Mittwochmorgen, da läuft im Bundestag gerade die Generaldebatte. Kanzler Olaf Scholz (66, SPD) brüllt Oppositionschef Friedrich Merz (68, CDU) an: „Sie können es nicht!“ Der Plenarsaal ist rappelvoll. Auf der Regierungsbank fehlt aber noch einer: Finanzminister Christian Lindner (45, FDP). In seinem Ministerium glühen gerade die Drähte. Auch mit dem Kanzleramt. Denn dort ist die Überraschung am größten über den wichtigsten Banken-Deal des Jahres.  > Der ablief wie ein Krimi!  > Dabei wollte die Bundesregierung eigentlich bloß einen weiteren Teil seiner Commerzbank-Anteile zu einem möglichst guten Preis verkaufen. Die Beteiligung ist ein „Überbleibsel“ der schweren Bankenkrise.  > Am Dienstag gehören dem Bund - und damit allen Steuerzahlern - noch 16,5 Prozent der Commerzbank. Bis Mitternacht aber wollen die Verhandler des Bundes - die Experten der staatlichen Finanzagentur - 4,5 Prozent dieser Anteile verkaufen. Sie werden dabei beraten von den Investmentbankern von JP Morgan. Nach und nach trudeln Angebote rein: jeweils um die 12,50 Euro pro Aktie.  > Showdown um Mitternacht  > Doch kurz vor Mitternacht tritt plötzlich die Mailänder Zentrale der UniCredit in Erscheinung. Mit einem Angebot deutlich über allen bisherigen: rund 13,20 Euro pro Aktie. Das komplette Paket. Alles oder nichts. Die deutschen Verhandler sind völlig überrascht. Dieses Szenario hatte man vorher nicht durchgespielt. Noch in der Nacht rufen sie nach BILD-Informationen hektisch im Finanzministerium an. Denn: Es herrscht Unsicherheit, ob ein so großer Deal mit der italienischen Bank politisch wirklich gewollt ist. Im Ministerium aber sieht man rechtlich keine Möglichkeit, die Auktion zu beeinflussen. Und doch: Auch das Kanzleramt soll schnellstmöglich über den Überraschungs-Deal mit UniCredit Bescheid wissen.   > Schließlich sieht man dort seit Langem einen größeren Einstieg der Italiener am kritischsten: Scholz-Staatssekretär Jörg Kukies (56), Ex-Investmentbanker von Goldman Sachs, galt stets als Fan einer fusionierten deutschen Großbank aus Deutscher Bank und Commerzbank. Was also sagt er zu dem nächtlichen UniCredit-Deal?  > Das Finanzministerium versucht, auch ihn zu erreichen. Nach BILD-Informationen mehrfach. Per Telefon. Auf dem Handy. Zunächst vergebens. In Banker-Kreisen scherzt man, die Regierung habe den UniCredit-Deal verpennt!  > Fakt ist: Am nächsten Morgen gibt UniCredit die nächste Überraschung öffentlich bekannt: Auf dem freien Markt habe man sich ein weiteres Paket an der Commerzbank gesichert, insgesamt also sogar neun Prozent, ein Mega-Deal. Entsetzen bei der Commerzbank selbst, vor allem bei den Angestellten. Die Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft Verdi warnt vor einer Übernahme und damit drohenden Jobverlusten: „Wir sind sehr besorgt wegen der Anteilskäufe der UniCredit an der Commerzbank und lehnen eine mögliche Übernahme kategorisch ab“, so Verdi-Gewerkschaftssekretär Stefan Wittmann zu BamS.  > Tatsächlich hat UniCredit-Boss Andrea Orcel aus seinem Übernahme-Wunsch nie einen Hehl gemacht. In dieser Woche ist er diesem Ziel einen gehörigen Schritt nähergekommen. In der Regierung herrscht Kopfschütteln. Über die eigene Schläfrigkeit. Zudem wertet man das Verhalten der Italiener als feindlichen Akt.  Da man nach Medienberichten (siehe Artikel) jetzt schon Wege sucht gegen eine Übernahme vorzugehen, im Wissen über potentielle Probleme/Verstimmungen mit der EU/Italien, scheint man den Deal überhaupt nicht auf den Schirm gehabt zu haben weil von höchster Stelle keine Ansage kam so eine Entwicklung direkt aufzuhalten.', 'Dieser Vorgang beschreibt die Kompetenz der Behörden und der Politik besonders gut: es gibt keine!  Erst Aktien an die UniCredit verkaufen und sich dann beschweren, dass die UniCredit Aktien der Commerzbank kauft. Das ist echt ein smarter Move! Man darf sich echt nicht fragen, was die Entscheider außer Kaffee trinken so den ganzen Tag machen.', 'Realsatire. Stellt sich hin als hätte er nichts tun können als es jetzt im Nachgang zu kritisieren.   Preisfrage ist ob die UniCredit die CoBa überhaupt kaufen kann oder die verbleibenden Anteile des Bundes ausreichen um einen Squeeze Out zu verhindern.', 'Man sollte die Berater der Bundesregierung mal genauer unter die Lupe nehmen; auch strafrechtlich. Da sind so viele Interessenskonflikte.', 'Es ist einfach traurig, dass Deutschland einfach nichts aus dem Brexit gelernt hat. Es sitzt schon die EZB in Frankfurt und dennoch hat es quasi nichts aus London nach Frankfurt geschafft, sondern nach Paris und Amsterdam. Dann passiert sowas und das ist doch einfach nur erbärmlich. Er ist ja nicht nur Kanzler, sondern war auch noch zum Brexit Finanzminister. Absolutes Versagen von Scholz.', 'Was genau soll das Problem an der Übernahme der Commerzbank sein? Für Monopolgefahren gibt es Behörden, die das überprüfen. Da hat weder ein Finanzminister noch ein Kanzler was mitzusabbeln.  Das Ding wird in absehbarer Zeit nicht auf den damaligen Kaufkurs zurückgehen, also entweder man HODL das Ding oder man verkaufts.', 'Für Banken hatte Olaf schon immer was übrig.', 'Wirecard, Cum Cum, Cum Ex wurden vergessen, aber wehe die bösen Banken machen ein bisschen M&A.  Zumal im selben Zeitraum mit der DB Schenker ein staatliches Unternehmen an verkauft wurde.', 'Tja Olaf, wenn deine Regierung da nur irgendwas hätte machen können.', 'Böse böse!  >""Deshalb hat sich die Bundesregierung in dieser Sache klar positioniert und macht sehr klar, dass wir das nicht für ein angemessenes Vorgehen halten...""  Und nun?  Edit: Ist das so in etwa das gleiche, wie wenn sich die Bundesregierung bei der Katastrophe im Ahrtahl positioniert ""Das ist alles ganz schlimm""?', 'Als die Commerzbank gerettet werden musste, war keine Bank zum Engagement bereit. Aber wenn es wieder läuft und das staatliche Risiko sich wieder relativiert, sind die Geier da.  Banker die nur auf Leichenfledderei aus sind, sollten es zur Auflage bekommen, gestrauchelten Kleinbetrieben helfen zu müssen!', 'Kann JP Morgen hier behaupten sie hätten mit Olaf gesprochen, der hat wohl wieder Aussetzer?  /s', 'Olaf *deeply concerned* Scholz.

Wie soll das funktionieren wenn Übernahmen zwischen zwei europäischen Banken schon so blockiert werden?   Vor allem so eine direkte Einmischung des deutschen Kanzlers ist Gift für Vertrauen in die europäische Kapitalmärkte.', 'Herr Scholz sollte versuchen sich an die Tage mit der Warburg-Bank zu erinnern, bevor er hier rum pupt.', 'Was juckt es der Bundesregierung, wenn ein Unternehmen ein anderes Unternehmen kauft?', 'Seit wann schert sich Olaf auch nur den leisesten Dreck um den Mittelstand? Meine Prognose: Jetzt Wahlkampfgetöse, klare Kante, blablabla. Dann wiedergewählt werden (ja, für so dumm halte ich die Deutschen tatsächlich), und dann unter der Hand die Übernahme durchwinken. Ich bin mir sicher, dass das auch für ihn und seine Entourage sicher nicht zum Nachteil gereichen wird. Und wieder zeigt sich: Quatschen ist das Eine, Machen das andere - an ihren Taten werdet ihr sie erkennen.']"

Their production costs are too high, so they are trying to trim it.  Not exactly sure how laying off thousands of employees will increase productivity, but I've stopped trying to understand why the MBA types do what they do."", 'I mean, here in the region, vw is known for being a very generous employer. I know non engineer people who get paid 70k a year straight from uni  for making PowerPoint presentations and dodging responsibility. I also know someone who did his apprenticeship there, where its job was it to explain and show vr to Boomer.   This is only the tip of the iceberg. The whole thing lacks proper management, and productivity is ridiculously low. Also, the whole process is  inflexible, and processes take a long time with a lot of paperwork. It\'s not surprising that this whole thing wasn\'t sustainable. There is this saying ""wer nicht mit der zeit geht, geht mit der zeit,"" which translates to"" who who doesn\'t go with the times, will go (away) over time.   I really hope this whole thing will get better, because otherwise the whole region where I live will have massive problems. It\'s not only vw.

This will also mean that houses will be incredibly cheap in the next years, and i don\'t work for any of these companies.', 'Too much unused capacity. They said, that they need to sell 2 plants worth of vehicle output more than they do at the moment.   Since all their brands are profitable (including VW) but VW lacks in margin they want to bring the margin back up to the magical 8%, hence cutting of overcapacity.  Now you can ask yourself, why they sell less cars to have such over capacities. Might be some diesel gate, paired with too expensive cars for the brand with a sprinkle of dismissing the future and not wanting to change.     Besides that, VW likes to cry to our politicians waaaaay before other auto makers do, so politicians come to help and they can carry on with daily business.  What makes it a big deal for public discussion, basically is the cancelling of the so called employment guarantee. Which is/was a luxury only for VW employees.', 'German car manufacturing is in crisis bc their management is so risk averse and seemingly allergic to innovation, that they let French, Italian and Chinese manufacturing take the biggest slices of the E-mobility market', 'Top management doing top management things.

VW is a major economic force in the region. They are a lynchpin of the local economy.

The world around them has been moving at light speed and they are stuck using SAP Success Factors and excel sheets.

And you get paid insanely good there, normal worker in production with night shift bonus averages like 3k€/month. Now many people are in fear of getting fired and the whole city is dependent of VW.

That is no brand that feels sporty. no Cupra  If I was to see Audi win, I would not be urged to buy a car..."", 'I work for VW and the situation is more dumb as one can think of. Basically in the past VW AG decided to get away from the ‘outsource everything to supplier and we’ll integrate’ model to develop inhouse which if would have worked fine could have mitigated most of the software issues. The thing is that when they created CARIAD it ended up with a lot of internal conflicts between brands and old managers with the same shitty mindset of oursourcing software to suppliers. And the integration then became a huge pain in the ass causing billions of euros being wasted.  Morever when shit hit the fan, they fired all the external suppliers and most engineers leaving managers licking up the ass of higher management that they managed to cut losses. Resulting in Porche macan and Q6 etron delayed (PPE platform). Other german brands e.g BMW realised this problem early on and started doing software in house or did strategic partnerships with big US companies like Qualcomm, AWS to have future proof software and Cariad is basically slept on it.   I still think with this new SDV approach that VW is now taking is the right approach but they are too late to the game. Plus the whole German mindset of save cost and not betting on the future further worsens the problem. You gotta burn money, bet on good software like Tesla and Rivian and penetrate the market before being profitable. I hope with SDV it changes (there’s new management for this project entirely US based and  VW is slowly starting to realize that software is not something they can spend some years on and get done with it and then move back to making cars. It’s rather the most important and needs to continuously innovated)', 'It was obvious from the beginning that VW can’t compete with China’s EV industry. The biggest market for EV‘s is located in China and most of their people buy locally. USA uses Tesla‘s and Toyota EV‘s therefore the main market for VW was Europe which didn’t work out well as we know. I am surprised that the management of a multi billion dollar company did such horrendous errors. Almost seems intentional. But nah why would they right? Wouldn’t be surprised if VW gets bought by a Chinese automative company. Nothing unusual these days China invests HEAVILY internationally in all sectors.', 'Because everything in Germany is bloody expensive for our salaries. Just go to any city in Germany and you will see, nobody can afford a car anymore unless they already own a house or have an old rent contract', 'After tens of billions of Euros in state aid   they realised that they should have used that money   instead of stealing it.  They have survived for 64 years on tax payers money due to the Volkswagen Act.   Their time is up.', 'Arrogance and complacency.  Chinese competition overtook the market but VW execs thought they ruled the world with their lobbyists.  Hard landing.', 'VW, like most of Germany, is stuck in the past and slowly but steadily the bills for it are arriving.', 'The reason is China but not totally because of the competition in Europe. VW was/is waaaay too exposed to the Chinese market, so much so that they’ve doubled and tripled down on it. Over 40% of their global profit and one point was made solely in China - at least double that of any other non Chinese automaker.  Now that Chinese domestic consumer demand has collapsed, and Chinese buyers are mostly going for Chinese domestic brands It has left Volkswagen in a very bad position, for which they are trying to cover things up. Add to the fact that the Chinese government subsidizes every Chinese domestic brand to the point where European brands cannot compete on price and you have the mess that Volkswagen is in.  In reality, I think it’s Volkswagen just trying to play the German government for a better labor position and more protections. Shoot - the third largest Volkswagen shareholder is a German state. I don’t think that they will take kindly to losing such a big portion of their tax base.', 'German car industry is having its Kodak moment.', 'VW is basically the worst in revenue per headcount in comparison to major auto manufacturers by not a small margin so it should be no surprise that at some point they need to start looking at reducing headcount.

They make almost double the sales per employee!!  Volkswagen is way to big and inefficient. This is known for years and now that the EV launches are a disaster and we lost track in China (i think people still underestimate Chinas pride in their own goods and that china only wants you as long as they need you to win, but drop you once they own the advamgate over you), Oliver Blume must do something. This is why he now needs to build up internal performance pressure quick or he is gone in months. I can tell you, past years, there was basically none. (It's a general German observation: we lived for decades from our substance and were losing our advantage at all sides. Same for Volkswagen.) I too belive, Volkswagen would be better off with at least -20% of their staff and getting rid of a management level.  The EV from VW are all extremely bad: no fast charging due no 800 V architecture, interiour look and feel is cheap as a kids toy, no digital connectivity (a car is more a smartphone today but car makers are afraid of accepting THEY are becoming a platform for apps only and lose control over car software), low range/inefficient, no real novelties that would boost sales, did I say they are ugly and have not at all prestigious enough, and of course they are way to expensive for such a bad product. Lastly, 2nd and 3rd hand market for cars is still a problem. As no one knows how this market will turn out, no one.makes a move and tries to build something for this market segment.  Then, former CEO Diess tried to have an own car software champion, CARIAD, within years. Strategy of building up such a company from scratch is generally speaking not that bad, but they used their own staff for it. They pulled together every free IT resource from every brand and told them to now make a car software from scratch. They forgotten these people are overpaid untalented project managers, not programmers. They could not deliver and thus hired consultants to do the job. Many people at CARIAD only wanted to wait until their contracted time there is over and they could return to their old position at brand level. This lead to a cost explosion, and now the whole thing must be closed as quietly as possible. So better make some noise somewhere else.  I think layoff and closures are a good thing for the company.

You can bet that Airbus already has a vague idea how an A320 replacement would look like and what resources they would need in order to launch the program. Launching such a program is always connected with a huge investment sum and a calculated ROI. They constantly monitor the market. They constantly talk to their costumers.  The A380 was the big outlier but here, I suspect, that prestige was a very important factor and the plane was then justified with a market model that was created with a bit of rose tinted glasses on. My guess is that Airbus wants to settle down a bit and strengthen the programs they already have at the moment. The A350 launch took quite a few years. The A320Neo had engine issues at the beginning (not their fault though). The A321LR and XLR are picking up steam. And for now, whatever new program they would launch, would eat into the new programs they have just set up. So there is not really a need to launch a new program from a financial perspective. A new MOM would hinder the A321XLR/LR, for example. And Boeing acted as the best Airbus salespeople Airbus ever had. Due to the Max problems, the A320Neo logbook is swamped with orders. Boeing's lack of a new MOM paved the way for the A321XLR/LR. The B787 is selling well, but Boeing's internal chaos connected with the B787 cost them a lot and really hurt Boeing. The B777X program has been an absolute disaster and costumers don't expect to see that plane anytime soon even though Boeing makes claims of the contrary. So basically, Airbus is just building and solidifying their portfolio. If Boeing had built a B737 replacement, I would bet that Airbus would be under much more pressure now. So it really depends on what the market wants and if there is any competitor that can challenge Airbus.  I only expect a new clean sheet model when they make such a huge technological advancement that it is worth to replace one of their old programs (like an A320 replacement/A350Neo etc.) or if Boeing, years later, gets back into the game and starts competing again with rebuilt company structures and a clean sheet single-aisle or even an MOM."", 'Next Gen Single Aisle aircraft - or as we all seem to call it, the A322 a clean sheet design to replace the A320 family     [https://theaircurrent.com/aircraft-development/airbus-ngsa-eaction-rendering-new-airplane/](https://theaircurrent.com/aircraft-development/airbus-ngsa-eaction-rendering-new-airplane/)', ""They're clearing the backlog of 320NEO and 330NEO orders (EDIT: and A350 too) for the next few years, while all the engine makers finish herding their cats into their respective pens. (PW need to sort the woes on the Purepower, CFM need to put down the open rotor nostalgia crack pipe and fix the - comparatively minor - Leap issues, RR need to go half a decade without a heavily publicised crisis that costs a billion a year and put their money where their mouth is with Ultrafan whilst also not pissing off too many customers with their new pricing).   Airbus have got the cash, initiative and (for the next short while at least) reputational edge on Boeing, and they've already said they're targeting EIS 2035 for their next product.  It'll likely be a clean sheet narrow body given they're fresh from the A350, but there are various concepts being discussed and bid on at various different sizes.  In terms of architecture the X66 could be quite disruptive, 8-10% fuel burn reduction is significant. That being said, the A350 was 2 years late on a 7 year programme (ignoring the A330 with new wings early phase), the 777x is currently ~8-9 years late on a 6-7 year programme, and the 737 Max was delivered on time to original programme, so there's a real possibility Airbus beat Boeing to the next Gen by 3-5 years, which could be a saving grace for them."", ""Boeing and NASA are in the early stages of producing [the X-66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-66). It will have longer wings than a 737 which fold like a [777x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_777X), but use the same gate configuration as the 737. It is not a clean-sheet redesign. The prototype is based on an [MD-90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_MD-90) airframe.  Boeing isn't planning anything new until sometime after 2035. The reason stated is that they are waiting for a new evolution of engine technology before developing an airframe. I speculate the next plane will be a clean-sheet replacement of the 737, but similar to the 757, which was supposed to be the single-aisle plane that replaced the 737 and 727. The new plane will have commonality with the 787 for training and other reasons.  Beyond new engines, the one thing stopping Boeing from development is airline customers. If Southwest tells them point blank they want an update on the 737 to match the specs of the 757, Boeing will begin development. If other operators tell them the same thing, it's a done deal.  I don't think the current problems with the 777x or 737 MAX is why development of a new plane would be delayed. They have factory space, they have engineering capabilities, and partners in place, they lack a reason to start development."", 'Personally, I’m waiting for them to extend and widen the fuselage of the A380, give it an engine either side, and have the fuselage be detachable in a similar manner to Thunderbird 2 so it becomes the ultimate cargo plane  They shall call this, The A3-8000', 'I’ve heard rumours of an A220-500 stretch to replace the A319neo for a while.

With all the scrutiny Boeing is under I think it’ll take them much longer to get that plane off the production line than previous aircraft. If airbus can ramp up production of current planes or start building more assembly lines they could potentially start and finish a clean sheet aircraft before Boeing finishes theirs giving them an edge to possibly beat out the 797 before it even starts.   In the mean time they have production constraints they need to deal with.

Listen to the interview with the one who discovered the pattern.   *So many market participants now regard an inverted yield curve as a harbinger of a recession, due to the indicator’s perfect track record of preceding an economic slowdown. Today, Jack interviews the founder of this economic indicator, Campbell R. Harvey. Harvey shares how he discovered this signal in the bond market in the 1980s, and how it has an 8 out 8 track record in preceding recessions (with zero false signal). An inverted yield curve is when short-term interest rates exceed long-term interest rates. Harvey’s specific signal on which he wrote his dissertation in 1986 (his thesis advisor was Eugene Fama, Nobel Prize-winning economist) was the spread between the 10-year Treasury yield and the 3-month Treasury yield. It is this indicator which has an 8/8 perfect track record, not the 2s10s (10-year Treasury yield minus the 2-year Treasury yield), which as Harvey notes gave a false signal in 1998.*  *Harvey argues that since his 10-year / 3-month signal inverted in the fall of 2022, the first and second quarter of 2024 is when a potential economic slowdown would occur (the average lag between the inversion of the 10-year / 3-month spread is 12 months, but the longest lag is 22 months). However, Harvey notes that there are several positive forces supporting the U.S. economy, such as fiscal stimulus and a strong labor market, as seen by job vacancies in excess of unemployment. While Harvey hopes that these forces can induce a “soft landing,” it is his base case that the 10-year / 3-month inversion will go 9 for 9 in forecasting an economic slowdown.*  *Harvey is Professor of Finance at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), Director of Research and Partner at Research Affiliates, and author of the book “DeFi and the Future of Finance.” Filmed on January 16, 2024*  [Campbell Harvey, Inventor of Inverted Yield Curve Recession Signal, On The Bond Market, The U.S. Economy, And Federal Reserve Policy](https://blockworks.co/podcast/forwardguidance/b00170bc-b64d-11ee-afe5-37f5e9ed4ae9)"", ""Amazing write up, really do love reading the quick concise info.

Jetzt hat der Leiter des Ludwigshafener BASF-Werks bei einer Veranstaltung Klartext gesprochen,78,All,BASF,"['Ein guter Kaufmann muss jammern. Aber das tatsächliche Problem ist meiner Meinung nach, dass das deutsche Bildungssystem immer schlechter wird und mit der immer diverseren Schülerschaft nicht zurecht kommt. Das verschärft den Mangel an vernünftigen Arbeitskräften. Das andere Problem ist die ungünstige Altersstruktur in Deutschland. Aber damit stehen wir nicht alleine da. Ich denke man wird sich damit abfinden müssen, dass Deutschland relativ zu anderen Ländern absteigen wird.', 'Naja, zumindest am ""Fachkräftemangel"" sind die Unternehmen nicht unschuldig.   Der kommt ja auch so ""überraschend"".   Es ist eben nicht so, dass man jederzeit und überall die gewünschten, gut ausgebildeten Spezialisten von einem Tag auf den anderen aus der Arbeitslosigkeit ""abrufen"" kann, (wie es einem passt) wo die seit Jahren quasi in Lauerstellung auf den Anruf von BASF & Co gewartet haben.  Sorry, aber ""BASF-Ohrfeige für Habeck"" klingt wirklich lächerlich.   Ein Unternehmen dieser Größe sollte in der Lage sein, längerfristig zu planen - länger als die Amtszeit eines  Wirtschaftsministers.   Was BASF auch sicher getan hat bzw. tut.  Meiner Meinung nach ist das lediglich der Versuch staatliche Subventionen, steuerliche Vorteile etc  abzugreifen. Nachdem das bei vielen Branchen/Großkonzernen geklappt hat, versucht es jetzt halt jeder.  Die Drohung mit der Abwanderung - so alt....   Sorry, aber wenn sich irgendwie 5Cent an der Arbeitsstunde ""nachhaltig"" sparen lassen, dann sind die Firmen weg - da würde nicht lange diskutiert. Da helfen auch keine Steuererleichterungen oder niedrigere Energiepreise.   Denn mit solchen ""Einsparungen"" rechtfertigt das Management seine Millionnenboni.  Die Vergangenheit hat gezeigt, dass viele Unterenehmen diesen Schritt teuer bezahlt haben.   Einige wenige haben es geschafft, die Reissleine zu ziehen und konnten die Verluste auffangen, indem sie sich wieder auf das Kenrgeschäft von und in Deutschland konzentrierten.  Die Drohung ""Produktionsstätten ins Ausland zu verlagern"" gehört schon zum Standartvokabular der Großkonzerne - egal unter welcher Regierung oder unter welchen wirtschaftlichen Bedingungen.   ""Malen wir mal den Teufel an die Wand"" - und dann stellen wir Forderungen...  Zumindest Wettbewerber würden sich über die freiwerdenden Fachkräfte freuen.  Wer täglich angeblich 4 Mio. Verlust macht, kann nicht von sich behaupten, alles richtig gemacht zu haben.   Ein Unternehmen, dass auf (durch den Steuerzahler) subventionierte Energiepreise setzt anstatt rechtzeitig auf energiesparende Produktionsverfahren zu setzen und günstige, alternative Energiequellen zu nutzen, hat halt den Zug der Zeit verpasst.   Wenn man 10 Milliarden in einen Standort in China investieren kann, sind die ""Verluste"" scheinbar doch nicht so groß.   ""Auslagerung von Teilen der Produktion"" nach China, ist bereits ein alter Hut und sicherlich von langer Hand geplant - und das ganz sicher nicht wegen der hohen Energiepreise.  Immerhin findet man in China ein politisch und wirtschaftlich stabiles System vor - nicht zu vergleichen mit Deutschland. /s   Aber damit kennt sich BASF ja aus, nachdem sie im April ihre 2/3 Beteiligung an ihrem Russlandgeschäft (& Belarus) aufgegeben haben.   In irgendwelchen Billiglohnländern muss man ja jetzt den Verlust wieder reinholen.   Und was man nicht verachten sollte: China ist jetzt was Umweltschutz angeht, sagen wir mal, auch etwas ""großzügiger"".   Wie Liebelt selbst sagt: ""das Dilemma deutscher Manager deutlich: Soll man alte Anlagen für viel Geld auf den neuesten Stand bringen"" - eben, in Standorte, in die man jahrzehnte lang lediglich in den Produktionsausbau und -Erweiterung investiert hat, nicht aber in die Zukunftsorientierung.   ""Auslutschen, Auspucken und weiterziehen"" - kommt einem bekannt vor.   Also alles in allem, eine vorhersehbarer und nachvollziehbarer Schritt.   Ob richtig oder falsch wird die Zukunft zeigen.   Was er aber nicht ist: Eine Reaktion auf Habecks Wirtschaftspolitik oder die aktuellen (ohnehin subventionierten) Energiepreise. Aber indem man die Politik dafür verantwortlich macht, kann man die eigene, unpopuläre Unternehmensentscheidung halt besser ""verkaufen"",  Es bleibt spannend um BASEFu. Es soll ja Unternehmen gegeben haben, die den Schritt nach China durchaus bereut haben.   Aber bis dahin ist das Management samt Werksleiter gut gepolstert im Ruhestand oder sitzt anderswo im Aufsichtsrat.', 'Ich verstehe den Artikel nicht. Robert Habeck ist schlecht. Okay was genau er falsch macht wird nicht erklärt. Wenn die Bundesregierung ausländische Firmen mit Subventionen lockt ist das auch falsch.

Folgerichtig werden in Asien Anlagen aufgebaut um den lokalen Markt zu bedienen, es erfolgt aber kein Import von dort nach D.', 'Firma geht ins Ausland, obwohl sie dank deutschen Subventionen und die hiesigen Arbeitern, die im deutschen, staatlich finanzierten Bildungssystem ihre Kompetenz erlangt haben, überhaupt erst erfolgreich geworden ist, weil es jetzt woanders halt billiger ist.

Von Mitarbeitern wird erwartet, dass sie alles für die Firma geben und unbezahlt Überstunden machen, in Kurzarbeit mit Abschlägen gegen und so weiter, aber auf einen Teil ihrer unverhältnismäßig hohen Boni zu Gunsten des Unternehmens in schwierigen Zeiten zu verzichten, ist kein Manager bereit. Dabei hätte das eine positive und vorbildliche Auswirkung auf Beschäftigte. Soviel zum Einsatz für das Unternehmen. Stattdessen lieber ins Ausland mit fadenscheinigen Gründen, um nicht die Verantwortung für mittelmäßige Führungskompetenz übernehmen zu müssen. Wie praktisch, dass man der Politik die alleinige Schuld zuschieben kann. Ihre Boni erhalten sie natürlich trotzdem, weil mit Personalabbau kann man Kosten für das Unternehmen einsparen. Ich hoffe, dass Deutschland trotz allem mutige und smarte Gründer in der Branche findet, die die Lücke im Laufe der Zeit füllen kann.

I am not one for cancelling the world.  But this was 100% unforgivable.    There have been nearly 30 summer Olympic Games.  Out of all the Olympic Games to model for, Adidas, and Bella Hadid, *intentionally* chose the one summer Olympics that was marked by terrorism against Israelis.  Not forgivable, at all.  Bella Hadid is a prime example of Pro-Palestine hypocrisy and dishonesty.  She claims that she gets backlash for being openly Palestinian, and maybe she does get trolls who comment on that - but for the most part, this is not true at all because the backlash she gets is from her behavior.    She mocked an Israeli hostage when he claimed the terrorists gave him birthday cake, and used it as evidence that he was treated well by Hamas.  And then she agrees to celebrate an event where Israelis were killed, presumably thinking it would be an okay thing to post on the internet   This is a prime example of what the pro-pal movement is.  People who say they are moral, they say they are for the cause, they have this persecution complex where they think they are black listed for their beliefs - but it’s their behavior.  It’s them protesting outside of synagogues on a Saturday, then complaining that they are “labeled” as antisemitic.  It’s them disturbing the peace, calling to globalize the intifada, and then crying us all a river when they can’t find a job or when people shut them out because they don’t want to be associated with their bullshit anymore.

It takes years, so it's pretty risky to do that just based on a current backlog.   Also, I would guess around 2-3 years of backlog is actually wanted, as you absolutly never want to run out of work."", ""backlogs are as long, because backlogs are long.  Airlines that expect to need a plane in 10 years order today.  If there was no backlog, that order wouldn't be in the books at all."", 'Big “Why are they not building more planes? Are they stupid?” vibes.', 'There is another A320 FAL currently being built at the MMS…there’s only so much one can do to keep up with demand. It takes 6-8 years to build just *one* aircraft, from beginning of production to final assembly. The backlog is nothing more than a promise of business with current orders and future orders being taken into account.', ""Expanding production is a massive project. If you just look at wings A320 takes up a massive portion on the Broughton site and staff. Replicating that would cost a fortune and even once built would take years to train staff and get the line certified to actually produce anything. That's to say nothing of supplier's and logistics. The Beluga fleet would probably need at least another 2-3 aircraft.  You would be looking at over a billion to fund it and and there is nothing to say the orders ever actually come to anything. It's not remotely unusual for big orders to be cancelled or production slots deferred."", 'Over 5000 airlines, and only 2 mainstream aircraft manufacturers.', 'Boeing have been restricted on the number they can make, and Airbus has a crazy number of orders', 'Air companies are planned their needs on a long time scale.

The sub suppliers of tier 1 tier 2 supplier of Airbus are still recovering from the covid impact and even those who did cannot keep up with Airbus, if the production rate were to be increased drastically. (Broughton might push out as many wing sets as they want, but they might just be sitting in the parking lot). And I think Airbus is contacting these suppliers who are in need of help to check if anything can be done to address their problems.', 'Airbus is building more production lines for A320 in Mobile and China and just opened a new one in Toulouse (Jean Luc Lagardere).  But as others have said, the bottleneck is suppliers and labor, not facilities.   These aircraft are all built by hand for the most part so you need a lot of skilled labor - and in some locations the labor pool is already drained. So then you have to either invest heavily in training, apprenticeship, school programs, etc which takes years to develop or you have to raise the pay for everyone high enough to get people to move for the job.', 'One reason I don’t see here is that the airline industry is very unstable. It would be a bad move to upscale production to the point where a market turndown would bankrupt the company. They have to run somewhat lean in order to not be overly leveraged.', ""It's the suppliers and subcontractors.  You cannot increase output of extraordinarily complicated machinery like today's aircraft practically overnight.  And then at some point you also have to make sure as you increase output you need to make sure you are also delivering quality product (cough cough Boeing) without skimping out on little things that could impede safety.  Airbus and Boeing (and the other manufacturers) won't churn out airplanes as quick as they did in the enormous numbers they did 80+ years ago as aircraft have just gotten much more complex.  Those backlogs are great but if you break them down you're also seeing larger backlogs for different airplanes.  An assembly worker in the final assembly halls of Airbus isn't going to come to work today working on building A321neos and then tomorrow building A350s.  Same with Boeing; that same worker isn't going to build 737 MAXs one day and then the next build Dreamliners or 777s (that'd be a lot of traveling!)."", 'Planes don\'t just sit around waiting to be bought after assembly.  Every aircraft is built to the airlines ""specs"" and every airline has different ""specs"".  Every airline buys planes for forecasted passengers in the future.  Years ago, the forecast was for a lingering low demand.  A lot of airlines didn\'t step up to buy at that time.  Now, the forecast is for ever increasing travel demand, so every airline is trying to play catch up.  Because all the airlines are buying planes, it creates a backlog.  In addition, airplanes are very complex machines so they can\'t be rushed in the build process.  You have the structures that have to be built, all the electronics (cabin and cockpit) that have to be installed which is miles & miles of wiring and then the engines that have to be engineered built and installed, as well.  And then all of the interior has to be installed according to the airline\'s ""specs"".  That\'s seating, galleys, lavs and anything else that the airline specifies.  They\'re a lot more complex than what most people can even comprehend.  FYI, Boeing and AB have both opened up more assembly lines to deal with the backlog.']"

You can find the source document that is roughly based on here: https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA009208 (PDF page 46, report page 33)   First, it shows 300 km (not miles), and that height of burst (HOB) won’t cover all of the continental U.S. (CONUS). A HOB of 400 km is needed.    Second, while true that a nuclear detonation 250 miles (about 400 km) over the center of Kansas would in fact create an EMP with a footprint covering all of CONUS, it would cause very little damage in the U.S. This is because the height of burst (HOB) matters for EMP effects, and that is far above the optimal HOB for the parts of the EMP that would cause damage in that footprint.    EMPs have two pulses to worry about, the E1 that can damage electronic with integrated circuits (devices, vehicles, etc.), and the E3 that creates geomagnetically induced current (GIC) on long conductors (think miles) like power lines, which can destroy essentially irreplaceable high-voltage transformers. The E3 can further be broken down into E3A and E3B.    E1, E3A, and E3B all have minimum and optimum HOBs. The optimal HOB for E1 is 75 km, and 400 km would weaken it to about 12 percent of the maximum damage (roughly over ground zero), which would also dissipate with distance from ground zero. Probably some SCADA equipment in KS, NE, CO, OK, MO, etc. would be damaged.    The E3B optimum HOB is 140 km, and it would be at about 10 percent strength with that HOB, and likely would not damage the grid.    The E3A optimum HOB is 400 km—but effects for that part of the pulse are hundreds of miles north, in Canada, where the power grid likely would be destroyed in this case.    A further limit is that the E3A pulse is only viable during the solar minimum and at night, because at solar maximum (we’re about there) and during the daytime, the ionosphere is charged and it makes that pulse extremely weak.    A final consideration is that a nuke detonation at 400 km would destroy probably tens of satellites immediately from gamma radiation, and hundreds or thousand in the following months as they passed through the radiation, especially in VLEO. This is due to system generated EMP (SGEMP).

Might have a lower forward multiple, but I think trailing is important to look at when considering downside protection.     One risk I was seeing that made me hesitant was the political incompetence in Germany. While Schulz authorized the 100 billion euro for defense, I don’t think much of that has been mobilized, and last I checked the “black zero” politicians were myopically holding up a lot of the release of the funds.  Even the budget released last week was criticized for its low defense orders.     Did they actually win $20 bn of Italian tank orders? I thought they just put in the bid and are awaiting final approval. I think it’s a JV with Leonardo, and Leonardo looks slightly more attractive given the lower trailing PE. Keep in mind that $20 billion is over 10 years.      There is also an auto division so keep that in mind. The auto division is doing poorly and is cyclical. Of course as defense grows the auto division should shrink in size.      Have you looked at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries at all?

So if there are 10,000 people in the queue waiting to buy tickets to the game, the ticket prices go higher and higher until there is no longer demand. What happens is people end up buying tickets are hyper inflated prices which cannot be resold for less than the paid price.   I checked for a less high profile game, which was Uruguay Bolivia group stage, and the cheapest ticket I saw was around $300. I have a feeling a lot of tickets were sold to resellers at hyper inflated prices. You may have seen a lot of empty seats but a lot of those seats were probably sold at a huge markup.', 'I got to see Argentina play Venezuela at Copa America Centenario and it was just so thrilling to see Messi play in person.

I would rather see smaller stadiums filled with dedicated fans who can sing all the chants and actually provide some life into matches that are silent when a goal isn’t being scored', 'CONMEBOL should be also written in green given that description.', ""US couldn't sell out one game.... As an American my excitement about 2026 has waned a bit with how Copa has been handled. Obviously, it's mainly on CONMEBOL but choosing NFL stadiums in parking lots instead of having some of the newer MLS stadiums host games was a huge miss. The Secondary Market also made the games incredibly expensive to attend and there hasn't been much outside marketing or buzz around it.

My Experiences of Reality vs Reddit...,4069,All,Deutsche Post,"['\'They say ""A little bit"" and then fluently speak it\' 🤣', 'RemindMe! 5 years', ""Thank you for sharing your experience, that's very interesting and beautiful to read.  And I think a lot of the friendliness you experienced is because you are a positive, open person yourself.   Surely it's also a cultural thing and I understand we Germans can come across as unsmiling and cold to someone from countries with very exaggerated friendliness. But I'm German, and I can't quite understand when other Germans complain about that because in my experience, you simply are treated like you treat others.   And I found it quite interesting to read that you didn't experience the language switching thing. I never switch to English as long as the other person is talking in German, but after too much time on Reddit I felt like I was a very strange minority lol.   All the best for you! I hope you make many more positive experiences!"", ""As a German I'd say the reality lies somewhere in between, honestly. The German stare for example is very real - my husband does it all the time without even realizing 😂 When I immigrated to Denmark I learned from an amazing Cultural seminar thing that the immigration process is something that happens (and is processed) in waves - the beginning (first 1-3 months) feels very similar to falling in love (you tend to see the new country through a very positive, even naive lense - in Germany we call it 'rosarote Brille'), then often follows a bump (maybe because of inconveniences you experience or general culture shocks etc), then it's nice again, and so on... untill you truly settle mentally in the new environment. That takes a few years. Like a rollercoaster - funny and scary all the same 🎢😄  So, I'd recommend to take your time! Enjoy the positive vibes you have, but prepare yourself for the culture shocks and setbacks- they are inevitable, and nothing to be afraid of.  Despite hearing all this in the seminar in my first week in Denmark, I didn't believe it - I thought my experience will be different and I will love this country always to 100%... well, I was wrong 😂 And Denmark is not even that different to Germany 🙈😄  My  advice is: don't pressure yourself. It could make the negative things worse.  Germany and Germans are wonderful, but we do have very weird things, negative things and people - like any(!) other country. Take care and enjoy the ride - it is fun, and even more so, when you acknowledge that there will be bumps and scary parts 😊"", ""Wait until you have to deal with internet service providers  Germans in general are not impolite or unfriendly.

In fact, if there was something that I saw here that I did like, my first reaction would be to go to the subreddit of my country and rant about how it’s not like that there lol.

In the first 6 months everything is new and shiny.

Unfortunately this is where the discrimination and racism kicks in.  I say you enjoy the bubble as much and long as you can. You will unfortunately experience the other side of Germany and it will probably sneak up on you and you’ll think “ah is just this time” and soon enough you will see it’s every single time until you get used to it.

65,1du80xl,2024-07-03 08:55:36,Why isn't there a bridge between Sicily and continental Italy?,20894,All,Continental,"['The Strait bridge is actually a really discussed issue here in Italy. There are a series of different issues:  1. The strait stands between two tectonic plates, so  it\'s a geologically difficult area (see the 1908 Messina earthquake)  2. The sea is very deep, which means this bridge would be the longest suspension bridge in the world.  3. Though the need of a technologically advanced costruction, this feat could be achieved and we already have a project, but it\'s very expensive. The strait and Sicily in general is however plagued by Mafia, so it is assumed that such a big project would just be good for the Mafia\'s pocket. That\'s why italian public opinion is generally against its construction  4. Political division means that every change of government is equal to a change of mind about the bridge. In the last 20-30 years the project has been picked up and abandoned every now and then. Recently it\'s been picked up again by the current government, so it\'s in a ""go"" phase. But I don\'t think it will ever happen  5. Sicily\'s infrastructure is terrible, so everyone in Sicily is basically against the bridge, rather asking for the money to be invested in highways and train lines. So again, very divisive public opinion  Edit: I see that many are curious about the mafia situation lol. In Italy we call ""Mafia"" only the sicilian organized crime, while other regions have their own (Camorra, \'Ndrangheta). The Mafia was very active in the \'80-\'90 with threats and killings, while as of today it has switched to a more sneaky approach, keeping a low profile and infiltrating projects where the money are.... which is exactly why everyone knows the bridge is exactly what they want (Source: my grandad was an anti-mafia prosecutor in Messina)  Edit 2: I didn\'t want this comment to be too long but I see many are asking for the same questions so i\'ll shortly specify 2 things: - About point 2, deep sea means that the bridge cannot have foundations on water, and must rather be a single bridge span from land to land - About point 3, organized crime do want the project to start but do not want the bridge itself. Something typical is that after the project starts there is delay after delay until a politician stops the project because too expensive.

While on the ferry you can leave the train and go sit on the ferry. It’s hilarious, over the top, and so wonderfully Italian.', ""Don't quote me on that but back at university (a decade ago or something) my 'roads and bridges building' (auxiliary subject for architects) professor told us that designed bridge over Messina Strait if constructed would have nearly the longest possible span possible with currently used materials. It would use 97% of it's strength just to support it's own mass and only 3% free to support traffic on it (which is still a lot of strength but small percentage).

The iron dome is for intercepting smaller targets like artillery rounds and rockets. There is no plausible scenario in which the continental U.S. is having to deal with such attacks. What would actually be helpful is Patriot, Aegis, and THAAD style systems to protect from ICBMs and SLBMs.', 'For anyone who doesn\'t understand, an ""Iron Dome"" is a series of interceptor missile batteries that can stop missile attacks from expected enemy forces.  50k a missile, 3300km East Coast, 2100km West coast  at 50km per missile that\'s 66 missile batteries on the East coast, 42 on the West. totalling 108.  I think any attacking force could manage 120 missiles at an extreme (considering the USA\'s Naval strength), so that is 120 missiles per battery * 108 batteries * $50k missiles = $648M  Note: This doesn\'t cover Alaska or Hawaii, both would need more because they are prone to land-based short range missile attacks, and Hawaii is very open in the ocean so may be impossible to defend. Let\'s just round to 1B for it.  TL;DR 1Billion Dollars!  EDIT: a few people aren\'t grasping that I am using an enemy making a reasonable attack. A hidden force somehow evades the US navy and then decides to Blitzkreig through Mexico to shoot subsonics at Utah does not make any sense, no missiles need to be placed there and should not have any basis in a defense budget spending.', ""EDIT: I was moronic and used r instead of r^2 before, I redid the calculation with r^2 instead and it got to a  ridiculous number:  Now I'm curious how much a literal iron dome would cost, from west coast to east coast is about 4,500,000 metres, this can be our diameter of a theoretical sphere around the US, 4πr^2 is the surface of a sphere, and a dome is half a sphere, so 2πr^2 is the surface area of this dome, where r is 4500000m/2 = 2250000m:  2 x π x 2250000^2 ≈ 3.18x10^13 m^2  Let's assume this iron is about a metre thick to make the math easy, so how much would 3.18x10^13 m^3 of iron cost?

We're more than half a year into an immensely bloody conflict, with massive media coverage, and people still dont know this. truly astounding"", 'Here’s my best guess:  We need to mostly guard from the north and west since the attack would come from Russia or China. But let’s say there is roughly 7000 miles of border we need to be able to cover and let’s reduce that since there are definitely ways to optimize this problem.. so let’s call it 3500 miles to cover.   Just to simplify if we only used THAAD which has a range of 125 miles give or take from the launcher. So that’s a total coverage range of 250 miles. So we need a total of 14 launcher locations to cover the required area.   We know that Russia would never shoot all ~1700 strategic warheads at a single location but let’s assume that a single point of failure would need enough interceptors to be able to handle 1/3rd of all of russias stockpile which would be ~533 warheads.   Let’s assume each rocket they send at us is a 50/50 split of 6 warheads and 6 decoys. So we would need to take out 2x the number of warheads coming at us so 533x2 =1066.    Let’s finally assume we need to shoot 3 interceptors per warhead/decoy to make sure it gets taken out.   Cost= Saudi Arabia purchased 44 launchers for 15 billion in 2017. So .34 billion per launcher.   A THAAD launcher can carry 8 missiles.   Ok so each of our 14 locations need to be able to take out 1066 warheads/decoys. To do this we would need to launch 3198 interceptors.   This would require 400 launchers at each of the 14 locations.   That’s a total of about 5,600 launchers.   That would cost about 1,902 billion dollars.   Or 1.9 trillion. This is incredibly back of the envelope but there you go', 'Google “Strategic Defense Initiative,” aka “Star Wars” from the Reagan era.   TL;DR of its history is this: in the end it was all a ruse to get the Soviets to try and match our research spending and thus destabilize their economy/waste money on nonproductive projects.  Both objectives were successful.', ""We already have an iron dome. It's called having a giant fuck you Navy and being bracketed on both sides by oceans. We also have an ICBM defense system called GMD that covers the whole US against a limited attack. Shorter range missiles don't have the reach to cross oceans.

The Bundeswehr\'s stocks have also been massively reduced in recent years. The Ministry of Defense has now ordered 155 mm shells from Rheinmetall worth billions.**  The German army has ordered artillery ammunition from the arms company Rheinmetall for up to 8.5 billion euros. A corresponding framework agreement for the delivery of ammunition has been signed, the company announced in Düsseldorf. The order is primarily intended to increase stocks in the German army and in allied countries, as well as ""to support Ukraine in its defensive struggle"" against Russia.     Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger spoke of the ""largest order in our recent company history"". The federal government is keeping its word and ensuring the capacity utilization of the future Rheinmetall plant in Unterlüß in Lower Saxony. A framework agreement in place since July 2023 had a maximum value of around 1.3 billion euros, and this contract has now been increased by 7.2 billion euros. The number of projectiles ordered, which can be fired 40 kilometers and have a caliber of 155 millimeters, was not disclosed - it is likely to be several million.     Rheinmetall says it will create the entire value chain for artillery ammunition at the site: the projectile, the fuse, the explosive charge and the propellant charge that drives the projectile out of the barrel when fired. The site will have an annual capacity of 100,000 projectiles from the second year of production, later increasing to 200,000 per year.  Deliveries are set to begin in early 2025, Rheinmetall announced. ""The primary buyer will be the Federal Republic of Germany, which will provide part of the deliveries to Ukraine.""

I'm currently at 115K miles.\xa0 I've kept up with all the basic maintenance, so frequent oil changes, brake pads, diff fluids, rotors etc, and have made sure to not push the car when it's cold. I use FCPEuro, so I've already gotten free spark plugs brake rotors oil etc..with their lifetime warranty and replacement services.\xa0   I've done a couple track days and autocrosses. I've had no real issues other than a small evap leak, which is a known issue and can be fixed for free at the dealer (or is a $120 fix). The coolant expansion hose broke while I was working on the car ($60 part).\xa0\xa0\xa0   When I bought the car I had absolutely no idea how to work on cars and didn't own any tools. I literally had to watch a YouTube video on how to jack up a car and remove the wheels. Since then I've been able to learn everything I need online and have quite the collection of tools. (BMW's do need a lot more random tools than other cars). I know that E90's can be a bit more troublesome, though the repairs needed are well documented.\xa0   So the cost factor really depends on if you can DIY or not. If I were to pay a mechanic to do all that work, the expense would be pretty substantial compared to paying a mechanic to work on a Toyota. (Although idk, it seems like mechanics are pretty expensive these days).   \xa0However, if you DIY, it's cheaper to work on your own BMW than to pay a mechanic to work on your Toyota.\xa0 The benefit of all this is that a fun car is fun and you'll appreciate it when you have it.

And yet when you look at used ones the BMWs are significantly cheaper when comparing same year and same mileage?  That's because the BMW is really that much more expensive than the Lexus.  It's more expensive to own, the maintenance is more expensive, the kinds of things that go wrong are more expensive.   Look up parts costs, a water pump, a fuel pump, an alternator.  I'd virtually guarantee you'll see that the BMW parts are 2-3x more expensive than the Lexus ones are.

Ich bin ganz bei dir, wenn es ums Interior und die grundsätzliche Verarbeitung der Bauteile, sowie auch bspw Kundenservice oder Markenwiedererkennung geht, dass Mercedes da ganz oben mitspielt. Sollten die ihre Wehwehchen in den Griff bekommen, wird die Aktie wahrscheinlich super laufen, ist halt die Frage ob sie aufholen können, während die chinesische Politik ihrer eigenen Autoindustrie den Rücken massiert', 'Hohe Dividende sollte im Regelfall nicht die Priorität bei einem Investment sein omg.']"

The demonstrator is an all-electric version of Daimler’s popular Freightliner Cascadia models. The so-called eCascadia has been fitted with a suite of high-powered, long-range sensors that enable it to “see” its surrounding environment as well as a high-powered computer that can process the sensor data and make navigation decisions.  Daimler, which is working with Waymo and its own Torc subsidiary on autonomous systems, says the goal is to launch the trucks somewhere in the Southwest US, transporting goods from hub to hub as part of a middle-mile freight hauling service in 2027.  We’re starting with “an autonomous vehicle that doesn’t sleep, doesn’t need to stop, and basically can drive continuously in the Level 4 hub-to-hub mode — that is our targeted use case,” said Joanna Butler, head of Daimler’s global autonomous technology group, in a briefing with reporters.  Daimler Truck is “fully committed” to bringing the autonomous Freightliner to series production, but only when the company deems the technology safe enough to begin testing on public roads.

I’m glad he is sober now but I gotta be honest he, his natural curiosity and optimism coupled with drug induced obliviousness and total lack of inhibitions got him into some situations that I swear could have been taken from Mr Bean. He must have been born lucky or his abuela said a lot of prayers to keep him safe cuz he never really got into actual harms way which is why I feel I can laugh about it lol.

My company is currently adopting SAP for the ERP planning side of things but they somehow convinced my c suite that we should also get rid of bigquery, cloud functions, Looker, and any components of data warehousing/BI in favor of the SAP version. We are still in the early phases of the adoption but I’m already extremely frustrated with the SAP experience. They keep scheduling calls with me for “understanding” with like 5-6 consultants on each call but not a single person has actually worked as an engineer or analyst in any capacity. It’s all just a bunch of slimy sales people or account executives trying to sell extra shit.', 'Every time I’ve ever had to utilize or interact with SAP it’s been a horror story.

Everything takes forever to get done.', 'I find with almost all vendors that they start with a really good core team with a vision, they are loyal to their customers and build great relationships, but eventually they grow big enough and then they turn into a money making machine. I get that businesses need to make money, the problem though is that it\'s no longer about a long term vision of the future, it just becomes ""what can we do to get the market to think we\'re doing well for the next quarter or 2"". Effectively it becomes a game of chess where the point isn\'t experience the joy of the game, but to min/max the experience financially in the most shortsighted way possible.   So this isn\'t specific to SAP obviously, but holy shit is it disheartening in this industry. Having been on the vendor side for a number of years I absolutely hate how dishonest a lot of people were with customers and how dishonest leadership was with us.', ""We have the entire large company's data in bigquery and integrated into standard reporting, and run basically the whole business off of it, other than the only outlier, finance. That's because they are insistent on running their org on SAP, and their instances are, by a really incomparable margin, the most tangled and inscrutable database schema I have seen in my life.  For example, looking right now, choosing randomly I see a table called ado\\_21. There is also ado\\_1, ado\\_6, ado\\_12, no numbers in-between, inexplicably just 1, 6, 12, and 21.  They have completely different schemas, I actually don't see how they could be related at all looking at the columns. Looking at one of them, it has 329 columns. Many of the columns are similarly inscrutable combinations of letters and numbers, although in some tables the numbers go as high as the 60s with no gaps, 60 columns with the same name and a number suffix.  In this one sap hana instance there are 378 distinct tables, mostly like that. The business has, it appears, 7 sap hana instances. They appear to have similar numbers of tables with similarly absurd schemas. So quite literally thousands of tables and like, idk, 100,000 distinct columns.  At a glance they look similar but are in fact not the same schema. This one has ado 1, 4, 6, 12. Another has those plus 5, 15, 26.  I told them the data org won't touch it.

As I am informed, it is unfortunately all the same with every bank in Germany.', 'That\'s weird that it doesn\'t update after getting cash. Are you using an app or browser? Are there different Commerzbank apps in the app store?  Sure, try a different bank. A pure internet bank for example. Comdirect belongs to Commerzbank so maybe you can easily open an account there. But there are so many other online banks to choose from.  The ones that are centered around an app do what you are asking for.   I get a message the second I take out money. And if there is a delay between transactions due to different bank groups or some other reason my app states something like, ""this amount will be deducted on this date.""  So try a different bank for sure, that sounds super annoying. Comdirect, DKB, C24 Bank and N26 have good reviews. Depending on the online bank you usually get a free Visa or Mastercard debit card. Some offer EC card but for an extra charge. All have slightly different fees, percentages, minimums, maximums, so do some research and find the best solution for yourself.', 'Get a “normal” bank like N26 or Revolut for daily payments so they will appear in the app whenever transactions are made. Those banks won’t have a physical office but they will have much more close to the regular banking experience in 2024 outside of Germany.  I don’t know why you think Commerzbank “knows the number” and just doesn’t tell you. I’m pretty sure they don’t themselves and the system works as a broken credit card and you probably might go negative and in that case they’ll just contact you and ask for the money.', ""I'm with Commerzbank and I never experienced this..."", 'I have the same problem, and I hate it. So I use Revolut for my daily transactions.', 'My husband, me and two kids have accounts at Commerzbank. I manage all 4 in my app.  I never had these issues this bad.   Example: I transfer money to my husbands account so he can withdraw some for me too (rural area, the next Commerzbank is in the next city). It is instantly gone in my account, but doesn\'t show up in my husbands until the NEXT day (not dayS or a week). But when he is at the atm, it is already there.   Easter with its two Feiertage was a special case. It showed rent and stuff ""vorgemerkt"" for April 2nd since March 28th. As you know, there are no transactions on weekends or holidays. But the system knew what will happen and when. Just like you said.   I tried Sofortüberweisung once to my husband (never used it before because it costs 1,50 Euro), it didn\'t show the correct balance. I closed and opened the app again after 5 minutes, there it was.   Even when I get a notification that there is a Geldeingang (incoming money?) And then open the app to have a look, it is not shown.   But to be honest, it doesn\'t bother me that much. Since we mostly pay in cash, we know the balance just like you do.', 'Same problem here. Wrote review in AppStore about it and they replied they are working on it and “please be patient”.   It doesn’t matter if I make a debit card payment, use the virtual debit card (feels like a spaghetti solution just to make online/Apple Pay payments possible), make a withdrawal in their own ATMs, a transfer - the balance is days/weeks old.   If I go to their terminal (SB something) in their branch to check the balance- it’s still wrong. Showing same as in the app.   It’s 2024 and my expectation is that the visible balance is also what’s actually available.

It has been shown that what needs to occur is a fairly specific balance between challenge and ability. You need to be able to perform well enough to achieve flow state, but if the task is too easy it becomes boring (this notion ties in with the zone of proximal development if you subscribe to that theory of learning).  Without going on for too long, recent research I have seen has been focused a lot on how to begin eliciting flow state in athletes (specifically individuals - to this end, things like mindfulness exercises have been shown to potentially help) and how to utilize flow state to incur potential advantages in other areas of life such as sleeping or eating patterns.  The topic is really widely applicable too, everyone can get to this state in potentially any scenario given the right conditions and it can help in so many different areas.

The caveat is they do not tolerate neglect very well. The maintenance schedule is meant to be followed to a tee - neglect maintenance and it will turn into an utter POS a lot faster than something like a toyota that would generally run ok as long as you change the oil every 25,000mi or so"", 'ALL vehicles in this price range are ""compromised"" on one level or another in order to meet the price point.  The question is, how are the compromises made and which would you rather live with?  If you value reliability above all else, then you\'ll tolerate some compromises in interior materials quality, NVH mitigation, fancy gizmos, and vehicle handling/performance.  In that case, you\'ll look at Honda/Toyota.  If you value having a vehicle that looks and feels more ""upscale"" and is more enjoyable to drive, then you\'ll be willing to tolerate putting in a little more effort in terms of maintenance and repairs, and will look at VW/Mini.  That\'s an oversimplification, but you get the gist.  Basically, it\'s hard to truly ""have it all"".  You could also go with something like Mazda or Subaru, which sort of splits the difference.', 'Volkswagens are a love hate relationship. When it’s working you’ll love it. But you’ll hate working on it or the bill for it getting worked on.', 'The GTI is the best car ever built', 'They’re good for the first 5 or so years then get rid of it unless you’re filthy rich. Repairs will kill you and make you hate it. Otherwise awesome cars.', ""I think it depends, my friend has had a new Tiguan since jan2021 and it's been running well with no issues. It's only 3 years old though so can't say anything about long term issues."", 'I’ve had several and they’re all been reliable. My 2017 golf had 104k miles when I sold it and had only had routine maintenance. Working on them can be a bit of a pain relative to a lot of other brands. They’re not necessarily less reliable, just more expensive when you do have to fix things. They do depreciate pretty quickly relative to Honda/toyota. I always had pretty positive dealer experiences on the rare occasions I had things done there.   I don’t know much about the 1.5t engine in the current Jetta and Taos though. Supposedly it’s more reliable than the older 1.4t which I only test drive but was pretty impressed with the combination of performance and efficiency.', 'I’ve had a Golf R which I bought used for 4 years now, and it’s been tuned for most of that time.  It’s been fully reliable, aside from some minor component replacement. I think for repairs I’ve done maybe $500-$600 over those 4 years.  I have had to keep up on the maintenance though, which I’d say is about $3000 over those 4 years, or about $750 per year on average.  That might not apply to a commuter car, though, but also could be more expensive if you’re driving more than 12000km per year', 'We had a 1.8 turbo Passat when I was a kid & the car never broke down on us. In fact, the only times it ever went to the mechanic were for oil changes & tire rotations. When we traded it in for a Saab in 2009, it was running just like it was when we bought it four years earlier in 2005.', 'For what it’s worth, I’m very happy with my 2023 Jetta. Great ride, handling, and fuel economy (~45 hwy mpg if I don’t drive like a nutter). I definitely recommend you test drive one, and if you decide to go for it, stay in top of maintenance.  I went with the sport trim, no sunroof, no leather seats (personal preference), but still find it to be very well-equipped. And, when I bought it, I was able to find one for $5k less than what Mazda, Honda, or Toyota could offer me. I like the DSG gearbox, and I did not want a CVT.', ""Good not great they're the second largest manufacturer in the world for a reason. Avoid the Taos.   The latest consumer reports rated the jetta poorly. It was primarily for very minor thing (infotainment etc...). I think the only legitimate concern on the newer models is premature rear brake wear. I'd take anything CR states with a grain of salt."", 'Newer ones are better, yes.    Our 2016 A4 and 2016 Tiguan have been outstanding cars.  I’ll continue to purchase them.', ""My 2.5 rabbit is awesome. It's an economy car that handles like a sports car."", 'I have a 19 Jetta S with a 6 speed and 1.4T. I’ve been extremely happy with it.  Only issues have been a N80 valve replaced under warranty and an intermittent blind spot monitor issue I need to get taken care of under warranty.  Pros: it was much less expensive than the competition ($15.7k new for mine), gets in the 40s for MPG easily, is EXTREMELY quiet and refined, comfortable, pleasant enough to drive, and the interior materials feel better than the competition (except maybe the new Civic), steering is extremely direct and precise despite having no feel. It’s also pretty massive for a compact car - plenty of legroom and a huge trunk.  Cons: jury is out on the build quality long term. Interior materials feel good (not as good as older VWs) but there are some creaks and rattles. Sound system is absolutely atrocious. It isn’t super fun to drive and the torsion beam rear is noticeable if you’re coming from a car with IRS. However, I still whip it around and have a good time.  If I could go back to 2019 and buy it again would I? Eh, I’d probably stretch my budget and buy a GLI, so I guess that’s a yes. I certainly still prefer it over the competition, except maybe the Civic.', ""The only VW I'd personally consider buying is the Golf GTI.  I'd rather get a Civic or Prius over a Jetta, and I'd rather get a Chevrolet Trax over a Taos."", 'We have had 3 now, and if it wasn’t for other people hitting us we wouldn’t have gotten rid of the first 2. Good cars.', 'It really depends on how on top you are on the maintenance. I’ve had a few, and they’ve all treated me well. But I always change the fluids on time or early, spark plugs every 15k (I’m tuned), and check the oil and look over the engine bay to spot leaks before they become a problem every other week. They do have their own problems (ie dogshit water pumps that can last 150k miles or 10k miles) and carbon buildup but I haven’t had any significant issues in the 100k miles I’ve put between the three Volkswagens I’ve owned (2004 Passat, 2015 Golf TDI, and my current 2019 GTI)', ""Not sure about good cars but I will say this from my own experience owning 2 Passats, a 2004 and currently a 2003 both with the 1.8T and a manual transmission. They are solid and reliable cars if you have the mechanical knowledge to do most of the work yourself.   Don't have the mechanical knowledge? Best find a trusted independent euro shop and have some cash set aside for repairs. My 03 passat is my daily driver and it has 278k miles on the original motor and trans.   I'm the 3rd owner and both owners before me took excellent care of it. I bought the thing with 240k miles lol. Off the top of my head it's needed an alternator, consumables like tires and brakes, couple coolant parts, some hoses. Basic stuff you'd replace on any car you owned long enough.   Hope this helps."", ""Pain to get them fixed?  Not as much as any other car... Pain to fix them?  I have mechanic friends who tell me they are horrible to work on, and they straight up refuse.  Info: Why are you knocking Nissan off the list?  If you're looking at reliability, Honda is your best bet out of this list."", 'I’ve had good luck with the few Volkswagens (‘83 Quantum, ‘93 Passat VR6, ‘06 Passat VR6) I’ve owned over the years. You do need to stick to the maintenance schedule, but you really should do that with any car.', 'It’s all about how they were/are treated. Every manufacturer has their problems, including Honda. Know of a few civics(16-2022) that the steer rack has gone with minimal mileage on them and Honda wouldn’t cover them/denies a history of problems with them when outside of warranty even with multiple reports found online. Another civic I know of clutch blew up on them under 50,000km while they were cruising down a flat highway (weren’t downshifting or trying to pass, just on cruise control)  Honda unfortunately has the name of reliability, but has slide down the ranks of reliability. Not saying that VW’s are amazing at all, they also are prone to their own problems, but the days of well built bullet proof cars I personally think is over. Outside of warranty one has to budget for 1000/a year in repairs.', 'A brand new one? Yeah.', ""I've heard many horror stories about VW unreliability over the years. My uncle's GF bought a GTI new, and the battery exploded when she went to start it. Let's just say she didn't have it very long after that. My aunt had an early 2000's Beetle, and it was constantly in the shop. My gf was given her mom's 2004 Jetta and that had constant issues for whatever reason.  However, my gf's Dad is a German car fanatic, and insisted he pay for half of her current 2014 Jetta SE. She got it at 30,000 mi roughly, and it is now at just under 100,000 mi. It has been more dependable/ problem free than my 99 Toyota Camry V6 and my 2003 Nissan Altima combined. I am honestly baffled. Must have been a good year and engine for that VW! Good gas mileage, too."", ""Honestly, as someone who's been working for a VW dealer orginisation in the after-sales. The modern petrol powered VW's are quite solid, no inherent issues. Sure stuff breaks but that's going to happen.     The EV's... yeah let's not go there."", 'We have a bunch in our fleet (rental company) and they do all right. See them frequently and they seem to be factory fresh a lot longer than most Japanese models. They are maintenance intensive though and you must keep to the maintenance schedule or yeah it’ll fall apart.', 'We have owned VWs in my family since the 50s and they have always been really good we switched to skoda in the 90s and they have been brilliant as well same reliable VW parts for less money.', 'New, yes.   Gently used up to about 80,000 miles, generally yes but you have to be careful.   Over 120,000 miles? I’m not interested.   As cars though I find them pretty boring. They do everything reasonably well and their well made, but there’s just something about them that screams “I settled for the cheapest German car I could find”', 'Yes and no. They’ve made some good examples that’ll last quite a long time with proper maintenance. They’ve made more unreliable cars than reliable though. It’s all year and model dependent. Skip Hyundai and look at Toyota Honda and Mazda in that order', 'I owned a Passat and it was pretty good for the first four years, then all sorts of problems occurred one of which left me and my family stranded on the side of the highway. Never again, sold it and bought a Subaru :)', 'I’ve wondered if the newer ones go through consumable parts as frequently like timing belts, turbos, and water pumps as the older ones did. If so I’d avoid one for my next vehicle. But if I could expect more than  100,000kms before needing major (costly) services performed I could live with that.', 'If you find one with regular maintenance performed at the required times, they can be good', ""Some are, some aren't. Mine were fine."", ""Friend of mine has a Passat.  I was impressed at how nice the backseat is.  Friend claimed he could really tell the difference between this and the non German cars he's driven.

Fully dealer maintained as scheduled, not abused, and at six years old and 81,000 miles the engine shit the bed with low compression on cylinder 4. A year ago cylinder 3 got a new injector and harness.   They will never see another penny from my family.', ""They're more reliable than they used to be. But they still suffer from being ridiculous to work on"", 'I hated the Jetta I was forced to drive in Highschool', ""I've owned 2, a 2012 CC I bought pretty rough at 70k mi, and recently a 2018 Tiguan at 50k mi. As long as you keep up on maintenance they will be excellent vehicles, I feel they get a bad rep because they can often be found cheap and bought as first cars for teens who do everything but maintain them   The CC leaked oil, blew its water pump shortly after buying it, and had metal shavings in the oil (changes every 5k) despite this everything in the car worked, ran smooth like butter and was reliable. If I was the original owner I'm sure those issues would have been avoided. The Tiguan so far is perfect, the previous owner took very good care of it and it's practically brand new."", ""The year is very different in reliability when it comes to VW ime. Also they are very reliable if well maintained, if not... Well it's anyone's guess at that point. I will say, they are not easy to work on. Loved my 98 Jetta but it wasn't well maintained before I got it, so it didn't last.

Same goes for Japanese cars too, must be made in Japan.

They did do a great job of capturing the 1970s vibe. The lighting was terrible. I had to turn off my lights just to see the show. The acting was great and Colin Woodell did a great job at capturing young Winston's mannerisms but he needed a dialect coach due to the fact that he didn't speak in a thick English accent like Ian Mcshane's Winston.   The plot was absolutely terrible and so were the fight scenes. Made no sense at all. The continental was supposed to help in world building for the JW universe but instead, it just added more confusion.   Like why the hell Winston still alive?! He killed the owner and adjudicator.

By the show's logic, every gun has to make its respective chambering noise as it appears visually on camera.  So everyone is just walking around unchambered until they draw?  At around 40 minutes in on ep 3, a revolver cylinder spins just so the audience can be cued into the idea that a guy has a revolver.  It's comical and immersion breaking.

It was supposed to be about how the working of continental goes expanding over engaging storylines. It introduced nothing new to the lore and it felt like it was just John wick but with winston set in past.  My biggest gripe was the cinematography. Why was everything so soft and underexposed? They knew this was to be released over streaming where the our home displays have lower brightness than theatres. They should have compensated for TVs atleast properly. But this shouldn't have existed in the first place because this style of lighting and colour grading doesn't really reflect the time period.   Thank you for echoing my thoughts in this and I'll be off as I need to cope with another disappointment by a streaming service's (NETFLIX) attempt of a live action adaptation of a popular IP (Avatar: The Last Airbender)."", ""I thought the first episode was good, I like the actor playing Frankie but don't understand why his and Winston's accents aren't like Ian MacShane's in JW.

Then episode 2 starts and Lou beats up those guys in the street in the most cringey and corny way (including dialogue). Actually, the dialogue is cringey the remainder of the episode. Also the acting is pretty subpar. Not sure I'm gonna continue watching it.

Apologies for the long answer though. TLDR below  1. Like others mentioned, SAP is a closed ecosystem and people find it very hard to switch out to core dev streams like Java development  However there are opportunities in BTP and Hybris/customer cloud (pure Java dev) to move out of the system but these are very few in number.   2. As a language ABAP is pretty dated , compared to latest  techs. UI5 is better in that aspect as it's a JS framework. But we still lag behind in this aspect.   3. The pay unlike general opinion is good. However the issue is there are not many great opportunities to switch which are readily available at a moment's notice.it takes time to switch.  Each company has their own customizations and configs. The basic ERP concepts are same, but because of these customizations, organizations prefer to keep a core set of employees in their team. Thus openings are there but less. We gotta be a bit patient.  There is a chance you may have to look at companies like Nestle, Mercedes, Shell etc (not exactly IT but well paying) whichever is available when you are searching.  Since most core devs switch frequently to increase pay nowadays, it becomes a bit tough and time taking for SAP folks.  4. It's a myth that major IT companies don't hire for SAP. Almost all of the FAANG companies + Microsoft+ Walmart had openings for SAP last year. Openings are less but there will be some every year.  5. Career in SAP is generally long term and there are opportunities to work abroad.  6. Startups don't use SAP due to its cost so that reduces a few high paying options for us SAP folks to switch as well.  7. SAP is not going anywhere. The cloud products are doing fine and it is much better than oracle ERP. There are no ERP s in market that can match with SAP as of today. Yes the UI sucks, but the reliability for the ERP (specially accounting) systems is key here.   TLDR : Opportunities in SAP are less (it's there in all major companies but less available positions available asap) thus it takes time to switch to increase pay.   It's a closed ecosystem so you can't switch to other languages or tech stacks.  These are the major downsides."", ""One trick ponies don't have a future no matter how good their trick is appreciated currently.   Over my career, I have professionally coded in x86 ASM, C, C++, C#, Go, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, JavaScript and few others to a lesser degree.   If you want to build your career on a very narrow tech stack like SAP, you will pay the price for it in future when that tech starts losing its relevance.

Papperger has already set his plans in motion despite the fact that purchase guarantees from the German armed forces or the German government are still outstanding.

There is nothing objective about this.  People are going to use this case as proof that glyphosate causes cancer, and you should understand... that is not what this means.  It means a jury or people who are not knowledgeable  was convinced of it in a completely biased legal setting.     \\--------     I have a BS chemical engineering degree from a well-respected institution, and completed almost all of my work for an MSEE.  I have been published, and I have patents.  I do not claim to be a genius, but I feel that I know what I am doing, and have a significantly better grasp of science and math than the average juror, especially people who have not studied STEM.  I have been called into jury pools 4x.  Based solely on what they know about me (sex, engineering degree) I have been excused from the jury each and every time except once.  I was called for a case to determine damages for a man who had been hit by a car.  During the  just selection process, the judge asked anyone if they has a science or engineering degree.  Two of us raised our hands.  The judge explained that there would be ""some math"" to consider in this case, but the math and outcome would be presented by their expert witness.  He then asked, that if we detected any issues with this analysis would we be able to ignore what we knew, and simply rule based on what they told us was correct or incorrect.  The other guy, a EE, said ""Sure.  I can do that.""  He was left on the jury.  They asked me.  ""Your Honor, if I was presented with a scientifically specious argument, or if I detected incorrect calculations, I would have a very hard time ignoring those errors.""  I was excused.  So a jury of 9 or 12 people who either do not understand medical science or who agreed to ignore what they know about medical science just determined that glyphosate causes cancer during a trial where they were presented with a few hours worth of almost certainly prejudicial data (You\'re not going to present data that doesn\'t support your position in court, that\'s not your job), even though thousands of people who are trained in medical science have spent a collective thousands of years worth of time trying to determine the same thing, and have been unable to.  Monsanto may be the worst fucking company on earth (after Union Carbide and possibly PG&E), but that doesn\'t mean their products cause cancer.', 'A jury decided it causes cancer but world health experts say there’s no link.   https://www.cancercenter.com/community/blog/2021/07/does-glyphosate-cause-cancer', ""People celebrating this win are no different than anti-vaxers.

Yeah, it's not a safe chemical for people in extremely high doses with constant exposure wearing no PPE.  Yes, if you spray a bee with it like a super soaker it'll die.  But that doesn't mean it causes cancer or is unsafe when used as intended, and no, it largely is not coating your vegetables, because it doesn't know to magically avoid edible crops, and is only effective when sprayed onto leaves."", ""People always say that folks against GMOs don't understand science.

Of course, as you said it is luck if you find a good team but there is no health check in management and you can get a very bad lead which could impact your career growth really bad.  I got bullied during layoffs by my manager even though logistics was not impacted at all at the end and I had zero negative feedback. Team leads don't hesitate to blatantly lie to not promote you. I was even told that the feedback tool had a bug (for over a year) and I wasn't actually ready for promotion as it was showing in the feedback tool so I had to wait another year. They can do it because they are bullying you with layoffs. Other companies announcing layoffs wrapped the layoffs process in a week and decided who is going and who is staying and done with it. Zalando dragged this whole issue for months and I really believe they did it so team leads can use it to their advantage. Is it really a coincidence that whole layoff process overlaps perfectly with the entire feedback period? I left the company before even layoffs were finalized but a friend of mine (working in a different domain) who stayed in the company got laid off.

No active judge from the appellate court called for a vote on the matter, according to the ruling.     That leaves the Supreme Court as the final stop if Trump wants to pursue his appeal any further, a move the former president in December signaled he may make.     A federal jury previously awarded $5 million to Carroll after finding Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, but a remaining lawsuit will determine how much more the former president will owe her for denying her sexual assault allegations while he was still in office.  In the previous trial, a federal jury determined that Trump sexually abused Carroll in the dressing room of a Bergdorf Goodman in the mid-1990s, holding him liable under New York's Adult Survivors Act. The jurors also unanimously found that Trump defamed Carroll by falsely denying her accusations. Carroll's remaining lawsuit relates to Trump's denials during his presidency, and the reckoning over it has been delayed by appeals over whether he had immunity over statements he made to reporters while still in office.     In light of the first verdict, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan found that Trump's liability already has been established, and the second jury only must determine additional damages.

Jetzt Anteile an Infrastrukturfirmen rauszukloppen, die klare Gewinne ausschütten und entsprechend auch Geld einfahren, ist so selten dämlich, das kann doch nur von Volker Wissing und Christian Lindner kommen.', 'Weil verkauf von wichtiger Infrastruktur an Private Unternehmen sich auch immer als soo gute Idee rausstellt.', 'Die überfällige Sanierung der Deutschen Bahn drohte durch das Karlsruher Haushaltsurteil zu scheitern. Jetzt hat die Ampel eine neue Idee: Besondere Verkäufe sollen es richten.  Die Deutsche Bahn kommt mit einem Kompromiss in der Haushaltskrise glimpflich davon. 12,5 Milliarden Euro hätte das marode Staatsunternehmen aus dem Klima- und Transformationsfonds (KTF) bekommen sollen –, bis das Bundesverfassungsgericht das Vorhaben durch sein Urteil zur Schuldenbremse stoppte. Jetzt scheint die Bundesregierung doch Geld zur Sanierung der maroden Infrastruktur gefunden zu haben.  Möglich machen soll es eine Erhöhung des Eigenkapitals der Bahn. Das Geld dafür will die Ampelregierung nach Informationen des SPIEGEL nicht dem Haushalt entnehmen. Vielmehr sei geplant, zur Rettung der Bahn Anteile an bundeseigenen Unternehmen zu verkaufen. »Damit ist die dringend notwendige Investitionsoffensive in die Bahn weiterhin gesichert«, heißt es dazu aus dem von Robert Habeck (Grüne) geführten Bundeswirtschaftsministerium, das den KTF verwaltet.Konkret sehen die Pläne offenbar vor, die Bundesanteile an der Telekom sowie der Deutschen Post zu verkaufen. Bei der Telekom, bei der der Bund derzeit 30,5 Prozent der Aktien hält, will die Regierung wohl nur noch eine strategische Beteiligung von 25 Prozent zuzüglich einer Aktie halten. Bei der Post hingegen soll die Ampel planen, sich von mehr Anteilen zu trennen. Die Bundesbeteiligung an der Deutschen Post wird derzeit auf einen Wert von etwa acht Milliarden Euro geschätzt.  Als sehr wahrscheinlich gilt in Ampel-Kreisen zudem der Verkauf der DB-Logistiktochter Schenker. Die hochprofitable Logistik-Tochter des Konzerns schrieb im vergangenen Jahr mit 1,8 Milliarden Euro den höchsten operativen Gewinn in seiner Geschichte. Besonders der Verkehrsminister Volker Wissing (FDP) macht Druck. »Wir wollen, dass das so schnell wie möglich vonstattengeht«, sagte Wissing am Wochenende in der ARD. Das sei für die Bahn, aber auch für Schenker selbst wichtig. »Und wir können diese Mittel auch gut gebrauchen, um sie in die Infrastruktur der Bahn zu investieren beispielsweise.  «Nach Recherchen des »Handelsblatts« sieht sich offenbar ein Investor aus den Vereinigten Arabischen Emiraten zum Kauf bereit. Im Bahn-Konzern hat man wenig Freude an den Plänen des Eigentümers. Schenker gehört zu den wenigen profitablen Teilen des hoch verschuldeten Konzerns. Würde es verkauft, müsste der Bund bei der Bahn Schulden tilgen – denn nur so könnte die Bahn nach dem Verkauf seiner Logistik-Tochter die Bonität behalten. Der Verkauf drohe so zum Nullsummenspiel zu werden, fürchten die Manager in der Konzernzentrale.  Erfolg für Wissing?  Obwohl noch nicht umgesetzt, könnten die neuen Finanzoptionen für die Bahn Wissing entspannen. Gleich nach dem Urteil aus Karlsruhe hatte man sich nämlich im Vorstand des Konzerns große Sorgen gemacht. Besonders um die Sanierung besonders stark belasteter Streckenabschnitte, die schon im nächsten Jahr beginnen soll.4000 Kilometer Schiene will Wissing bis Ende 2030 generalsanieren lassen. Losgehen soll es im kommenden Spätsommer, gleich nach der Fußball-Europameisterschaft, mit der sogenannten Riedbahn, einer Strecke zwischen Frankfurt und Mannheim. Dafür wird die Strecke mehrere Monate komplett gesperrt. Reisende müssen auf Busse umsteigen – oder werden weiträumig umgeleitet.  Mit den Sanierungen soll die desaströse Pünktlichkeit verbessert werden. Schon jetzt kommt in Deutschland mehr als ein Fünftel der Fernzüge mindestens eine Viertelstunde verspätet an. Ein Negativrekord. An die Ankündigung, die unpopuläre Sperrung anzugehen, hat Wissing seine politische Zukunft geknüpft.

People have to learn how to use a new system, the system needs to be customized or the company structures need to be changes to fit the limits of the ERP software. Because of that especially in the beginning companies have usually to fight and often view it as a problem at first. I mean it worked without the system or did it?    But the advantages are clear as well. The most obvious and the reason for most managers to get one, you have KPI\'s. By craving data about all processes you can get an overview about them with the push of a button. You see what is done, what is planed and what is delayed. You see what ressources you have, which ressorces are maybe missing and where you can free up ressources to make up for the missing to make it on time. Maybe you can even see how productive certain ressources are.   But not only that. You can organize documents, the documents are accessible by all (or by all who are allowed to). The documents have a status. If one person gets ill and the system is well looked after, an other person can easily see where in the process it is and whats missing. They can find all documents and step in to finish things if necessary. At the same time many systems record who did what and when? Often a review and approval process is implemented so you can even in a legal problem look to the system and it has documented that the process was followed and by that its not the companys fault. In fact you can implement certain steps the documents have to go through. By that forcing your people to follow the correct process and minimize errors. Some of these systems can even be used to build the documentation for a product almost automatically. There is no ""only person who can do it"" anymore. Nither is there the ""he is ill and i don\'t know where the documents are"" problem.', 'SAP has good marketing. They sell the product to people who make the decisions, but don’t have to suffer with using the product.', 'Unfortunately it’s not designed to make the lives of plant people easier. There are huge benefits at the company level to using it. I worked on a team to install SAP in one division of a large global chemical company 20 years ago. The division was operating globally using 500 different “systems”, some of which were spreadsheets. Most of those 500 systems didn’t talk to each other. When we started SAP, we were able to turn off about half of those. And then continued integrating more systems into SAP. The big benefit of an ERP like SAP is the integration. We were able to see product costing for every individual variation of product. This gives much more insight on running the business. Before SAP all we could manage to do was costing by large groups of products. Unfortunately many  implementations are not done well and training and documentation in companies that use SAP is also often a weakness. One of the areas I knew the best was the quality system and it’s remarkably flexible. Companies need to put good subject matter experts on the SAP team to implement it well. And need to have good consultants to show them what’s possible.

I have a study somewhere, I think from Reliabilityweb, about if people were happier with Maximo or SAP-PM and what the big factors were. It turned out the biggest factor in user adoption and business satisfaction was consistent follow-on training...like 12-24 hours per year every year, not just the go-live triage training. Once they factored that in, they were the same, at least to maintenance, reliability, and MRO (my areas).  The front end (if there is one) can be developed nicely also.

It works for me.', ""I've owned several McIntosh products and here's my thoughts. I had a pair of Thiel 3.6 that I loved. I used Adcom, Classe monoblocks and VTL to power them. Alas, they were power hungry and when those amps (all at or over 200w) clipped, poof went a tweeter. Of course I could've turned it down but some music has such dynamic range it's hard. After replacing my second tweeter (my dealer had a drawer full of them) I upgraded to Thiel 6.0. My dealer warned me they were even more power hungry and what I had wouldn't be enough. Plus, the tweeters were still an issue. So I did some research and found out about the McIntosh Autoformer circuit which manages clipping and saves speakers. So I drove my POS Honda for three more years and bought a McIntosh 402. 400 watts. The Thiels sounded great and no more blown tweeters. When you clip a light flashes to let you know to turn the damn thing down. The 402 sounded better than my Classe monoblocks but I also doubled the power. Then McIntosh offered a trade up program and gave me 80% of my original price toward an upgrade. I missed having monoblocks for ego reasons so I upgraded to MC 501. Holy shit! The Thiels ate that power up and sounded amazing! Rarely did the clipping light flash, but it did occasionally, just to keep me honest. Plus, they're build like tanks. No fuss, no tweaks, just power. When it came time to downsize my life I sold the MC 501s for 80% of what I paid and bought an integrated MC7200. Again, a great amp. Solid as a rock. I also bought a MA 6200 from an estate sale for $200. I used it in the bedroom system. I had it for over 20 years (making it around 40 years old) when a capacitor went out. I shipped it off to Audio Classics and UPS smashed to front plate. I thought it was toast but Audio Classics had the faceplate in stock and rebuilt the unit for $700. In the meantime I had purchased a refurbished Marantz Model 30 integrated because it takes a long time to get vintage stuff repaired. I really liked the Marantz and thought it sounded great so I didn't miss the MA 6200 that much other than for the vintage esthetic (and it was a McIntosh!) When I finally got the McIntosh back I thought about trying to sell it but I wanted to hear how it sounded first. Hooked it up and damn! Sounded great! It was truly not that much an improvement over the Marantz- maybe a little warmer- but I like it so much I'll keep it. That's why I like McIntosh and will pay the premium.   tl;dr- Bought a MC402 to protect my speaker's tweeters and it worked. I had a chance to upgrade though a trade in program and did for a pair of MC501 monoblocks. When I had to downsize I got 80% of my original price. I have a vintage MA6200 that had to be rebuilt and it sounds as good if not better than a new Marantz. I paid the McIntosh premium because of their build quality, circuitry, and value retention."", 'I personally think they are overpriced. You can get good performance for a lot less.', 'If you ever get a chance to visit the factory, it’s easy to see why they are so expensive. Basically hand made. They are very good, light years beyond consumer grade stuff. But value at that price range is a very personal thing. Best sounding? Can’t really say. I can only say when the husband and i went looking for a “Cost is secondary consideration” system. McIntosh was the first high end brand to be eliminated. I personally, didn’t like the sound signature. I felt the equipment colored the sound to much. Some people love it. I wanted something more accurate. But many people find great joy in ownership. I can’t argue with that. If it brings you joy. Then I don’t see a problem. But for my ears. Not for me.

I came to the conclusion that McIntosh makes really good sounding tube-based electronics. I bought a McIntosh MC275 power amp that I really enjoyed. It is the only used audio component that ever appreciated in value between when I bought it and sold it. I “upgraded” to a very highly regarded tube amp, the VAC Phi 200. VAC is a boutique company with a great reputation and commensurate prices. Honestly, I thought the McIntosh MC275 was a better sounding amp than the VAC Phi 200, which sounded like a solid state amp with bass rolloff, whereas the McIntosh has this magical, inviting midrange.

I am not talking about CD players and dacs but when you talk about amps and preamps, they hold their value. My buddy is constantly buying used McIntosh stuff, using it for awhile, and flipping it for a profit. It isn't like he is making huge money but he is essentially getting paid a couple hundred bucks to audition stuff in his own room with his own speakers.  As people have said, there are a bunch of brands that sound just as good or better and their used prices are much, much lower. I think it was the Audio Excellence guys who were talking about one of their clients needing cash quickly and selling another brand's sets of monoblock which were in the unopened boxes for $22K when he paid $40K."", 'Is it worth the price is the question of perceived value. There are some audio advantages, like great engineering - and a house sound, which comes from a custom approach, including autoformers. There are things like design and service/support, which add value, but don\'t affect the sound. In the end, it\'s also about how much money do you make - sadly, someone who made 100,000 USD today, doesn\'t care about price of McIntosh.    As for the sound: It\'s very good engineering. The type of sound you heard has to do with transformer coupling towards the speakers, it has to do with huge power supplies, and it has to do with the circuit design. It all leads to ""house sound"" that McIntosh nurtures. It has some advantages of tubes - and almost no disadvantages - even in solid state amps.

The majority of McIntosh amps employ autoformers that essentially remove amplifier/speaker interaction out of the equation, allowing their amps to sound their best with any speaker load, no matter how reactive.   Mac gear is also made with more expensive materials like stainless steel chassis, glass front panels that require lots of hand finishing and high-grade electrical components. The high-end audio gear sold in traditional retail channels which McIntosh labs is a part of have a minimum of 500% markup from manufacturer to the brick and mortar stores that sell their products.   That's why most of the remaining brick and mortar audio stores center their businesses on the high end, mega buck audio gear, much of which is firmly positioned within the luxury goods market sector that targets the wealthy who have loads of disposable income to lavish on their hobby."", 'Owned 2 of their amps so far.

Ohh God what will we do now, it\'s a great set of components. Don\'t get me wrong, that\'s until you figure out that in their price range?! There is tons of excellent competition to be found hands down.   I sold all my McIntosh gear at the time for pass labs,mark Levisons , even tube (for a while) I ran a jadis reference at most definitely lower prices than my mc gear.   Not hacking into mcintosh, but to pay claim it\'s ""the best"" and ""unbeaten by anything"" is inherently false . There is tons of great gear in that price bracket that easily gives McIntosh a run for their money hands down.   To me ? Personally,enjoyed it on my quads esl57 and Maggies. I could not get my gear to sound that great with the cones system I had at the time.  Then reading the comments ""great customer service"" bryston comes with a 20 plus year warranty. Costing but a fraction of McIntosh. I mean we really want to go there , tell me again how good it actually SOUNDS I could give two f less about someone picking up the phone. Just me tho (I know I\'ll get some audioholic hate over my opinion) that\'s fine. 😁  Been there done that mcintosh I don\'t miss it. I had a hard time matching gear to it and most definitely speakers. Over analytical, harsh even with some of the older nudells we had on it. Magnepans did great , the esl57 was fantastic on it somehow the auto formers color the sound in a way I just could not get used too   I really don\'t miss my time with McIntosh at all unfortunately as I do love the ""retro"" look of it. And they do make clearly quality product. It\'s just not the sound I was expecting..  Anyways not trying to sound like an hater, I feel negative experiences with it should be shared too. Keeps the bunch of you honest too I reckon 😆   *Also don\'t be mad and start flaming, it\'s just an opinion*', ""Well, it's mostly about name recognition at this point.  I can say that of the tube products I've owned from McIntosh it's reasonably clean audio but not really an inspiring sound compared to some other tube products.  Also all of McIntosh tube amps are push-pull designs, without any single-ended offerings to be seen.  Honestly I would like to see McIntosh release any single-ended tube amp just to see how well they would do with that type of design.  McIntosh winds their own transformers, these are huge and confidence inspiring, so probably a plus on that end of things actually.  Other components -- they tend to have decent parts, although for caps it's basically WIMA & Nichicon.  Functional but actually not top of the line on components.  From a reliability standpoint I've had issues with both my MC275 and my C8, although to be fair a KT88 failure probably is what caused the damage in my MC275.""]"

556,17tngiz,2023-11-12 17:13:46,Etwas stimmt nicht mit Daimler Truck,43,All,Daimler Truck,"['sie hatten letztens glaub gemeldet dass sie einen starken Einbruch der neubestellungen haben, wie so ziemlich alle. Allerdings gebe ich dir recht, die firma ist grundsolide und top aufgestellt. das Geschäftsmodell wird auch in zukunft mehr als relevant bleiben, technisch sind sie glaub auch ganz vorne dabei.', 'Was haben Trends von einem Monat bitte fundamental mit dem Unternehmen zu tun? Vor allem in einem schwierigen Marktumfeld, in dem praktisch alle Indizes gefallen sind.  Viele müssen sich mal von dem Gedanken verabschieden, dass eine gute Aktie mit solidem Geschäft nur steigt und jedes Jahr kontinuierlich +10-20% macht. Vor allem nicht in Zeiträumen von einem Monat macht eine Betrachtung wenig Sinn.  Erst ein Mal werden Märkte von extrem vielen Faktoren beeinflusst, in einem einzelnen Monat haben externe Events wie Zinsen, kriege, politische Entscheidungen viel mehr Einfluss als die fundamentaldaten. Wenn die Firma wirklich gut ist, wird der Kurs über viele Jahre auch im Mittel steigen, aber auch mal unter dem Jahr 20% hoch und runter schwanken.  Außerdem ist das Unternehmen neu, muss sich erst finden, das ist für Investoren natürlich viel riskanter als ein etabliertes unternehmen - wer weiß, ob das eine gute Idee war? Immerhin muss für zuvor zwei Produkte (pkw + Trucks) nun zwei komplette Konzern Infrastrukturen aufgebaut und bezahlt werden. Ich finde das Unternehmen übrigens gut, nur um mal ein paar der Risiken aufzuzeigen.  Das Unternehmen hat erst ein neues Produkt auf dem Markt gebracht, auf dem extreme Hoffnungen liegen. Ein paar Probleme, explodierte Batterien oder Rückrufe und ein top solides Unternehmen wird zum Sanierungsfall. Siehe Siemens Energy. Das ist kein Selbstläufer.  Gibt es einen komplizierteren Markt als e-vehicles? Nicht viele zumindest. Dazu noch Trucks und Logistik. Super Unternehmen, aber Risiko ist nun mal einfach gigantisch. Vor allem wird das e-Thema maßgeblich politisch getrieben. Der Erfolg des Unternehmens wird von der Politik der nächsten 15 Jahre entschieden, nicht nur in Deutschland, auch auf Europa Ebene. Je nachdem wie das Thema e-mobility politisch gehandhabt wird, wird das Unternehmen beeinflusst. Dazu eine extreme Abhängigkeit von Rohstoffen und China / USA, wenn es hier Probleme gibt, kann der e-Truck noch so gut sein…das betrifft übrigens alle europäischen Autobauer.  All das führt zum Chartbild. Ich überlege nachzukaufen, das Risiko ist aber einfach hoch und der fall nicht so klar, wie von dir skizziert.', 'Auftragseingang deutlich zurückgegangen.

Es ist leider so, dass Deutsche Hersteller bei allen Trendthemen hinterher rennen und keine Maßstäbe mehr setzen. Wenn sie da die Kurve nicht kriegen werden sie stagnieren bzw. absaufen und das macht sie unattraktiv für Anleger. Ich frage mich echt was kann man von seiner Aktie letztendlich erwarten?

Also thought Dutch was less of a fancy man showboat and more like a woodsman robber philosopher. Definitely I thought they were a lot overtly meaner.', 'I was surprised they had so many non gunfighters in the gang. The idea that they had old men, cooks, working girls, mothers, children, and the occasional stray that needed a helping hand really paints John’s old stories he tells in RDR in a different light.', 'I thought they were mean and professionals, like the payday crew for example  But there were actually a healthy family that always had each others back :(', 'I expected a crew of 7-8 outlaws who were cutthroat, lying, and trigger happy. I thought they had some groupies that followed them along to help with robbing wagons and banks. But I always figured they would always be on the move.    At the start of RDR2, I was shocked when Dutch said ""we need to get these folks warm"". Completely changed the way I thought of him since playing RDR1.', 'i never would have imagined Arthur existing. I remember hating the idea of playing as him when the trailers came out!  obv i love arthur now tho', 'A tighter group that was a lot more ruthless but still lived by a twisted Robin Hood type code.  I really like what RDR 2 did with the gang honestly', ""Definitely didn't think the gang would be as big as it was. Pictured something like Wade's gang from 3:10 to Yuma... 10-15 guys.  Also, weirdly enough I remember this one time years ago in a college class I was having an extended daydream about how I would kick off the story of a hypothetical prequel to Red Dead - the scenario I created in my head was one where the gang recruits a new member who wants revenge for the murder of his family/destruction of his farm. Basically, I daydreamed Sadie Adler's origin story lol."", 'Honestly my perception of the van der Linde gang was pretty similar to how it is in rdr2', ""I actually thought they were more ruthless maybe not as much as the o'driscolls but when dutch talked about how they all had Abigail..... that gang from rdr 2 doesn't seem the type to do that tbh. I wish they could've been a bit more ruthless in rdr 2. They were too goody 2 shoes for me personally"", 'A little more scummy to be honest. Kind of like the O’Driscoll‘s, but with less people.', ""Thought it was full of backstabbing idiots based on Bill and Javier. I don't think I necessarily saw them as blood thirsty or completely lawless buy I had a vague idea that they were pretty shady people. I was genuinely surprised at how many girls were in the gang and how organized and well put together it was. Never expected members like Pearson or Strauss. Or Swanson. I think I was expecting more people like Javier and Bill honestly. John doesn't really paint a pretty picture of his past. He knows what he is and what he's done. Just seemed worse than it is in hindsight."", ""Quite a bit like what we got, save for the addition of Hosea, Trelawny, and Straus. I expected Dutch to feel like the combination of the real Dutch and Hosea, but I really like what we got.   In rdr,John says they stole from the rich and gave to the poor, did more for people than the government did. Really just a bunch of robin hood style characters, some who use that mask to validate their violence and some who really believe in it. Javier and Bill were pretty much exactly what I expected, I thought John would fill more of Arthur's role, but at the point of RDR2 John strained his relationships by running off for a year. It was also clear in rdr they ran with prostitutes.   I wish John wasn't at the final standoff, so that the first time Bill and Javier see John it would have been like a man back from the dead."", 'Pieces of shit who had each other’s back before they betrayed John   That was true in cannon they’re not bad to each other but no one in the gang is a saint by any means', ""I always thought that John was essentially Dutch's right-hand man, but then they introduced Arthur to fill that particular role. But John was still one of the original members of the gang like I imagined, along with Arthur and Hosea."", ""I didn't know much about RDR2 when I bought it. Didn't even know there was a gang to begin with, just the main character and maybe some friends."", 'I imagined it as being just John, Bill, Javier, Dutch, Uncle, Jack, and Abigail and I imagined John and Javier being a lot closer than they were in RDR2 as implied in RDR1', ""I for sure didn't expect Bill to be my favorite."", 'In the first game John talks about the gang to Bonnie and they sound like a bunch of backstabbing, bloodthirsty killers who kill at random. Bill and Javier are shown as being selfish and care little about John or his family. Dutch especially seems more like a Colonel Kurtz like character from how he acts in the later part of the game. In the second game the gang is shown as racially diverse, follow a code and are generally more honorable besides Micah. Even the other gangs and law enforcement they come up against are generally seen as more corrupt and morally bankrupt. It’s a common device used in writing so you don’t turn against the protagonist by making the antagonists worse.   I find it a little odd personally cause it doesn’t match up to how John describes them in the first game. Seemed like Rockstar definitely rewrote the gang to be more likable and less deplorable. Arthur especially is a little too kind hearted and forgiving for me to believe his role in the gang as an enforcer. But then again we are seeing him past his prime with tuberculosis so that would explain the thoughtful nature of his actions.   I would have preferred to have seen the darker narrative of the Van Der Linde Gang they were originally envisioned with. It would be more consistent with the first game’s grittier tone, but I don’t mind the retconning cause it makes the characters more relatable. If they were all like Micah then it would have been much harder to care and root for them in the events that followed.', 'Pretty close to what we saw of them in RDR2. A lot of who they were as a gang, and especially Dutch, was set up even in RDR1. Especially when it came to the people he would bring on, and why/how he would. Also, John was simply too much of a dorky dad to make me believe they were any bit comparable to Bills gang.', 'People are mentioning how the gang is huge and its unrealistic and that they would get rid of useless members but Dutch acted more like a cult leader and the gang was more like a cult that committed crimes as a family to survive.', 'I was always under the impression that john was left for dead at the ferry boat where Dutch killed that girl', 'Part of the reason I was kind of against the idea of Red Dead Redemption prequel was I assumed the gang was literally just Bill, Javier, John, and Dutch. All of whom came off as thoroughly unpleasant.   And I include John in that because well John is a bad person trying very hard to be a better person. He’s violent, short tempered, sarcastic, and often sour. The Strange Man missions all kind of make a point of the fact that John is a deeply flawed person who has done some terrible things.  So I wasn’t particularly looking forward to a story when we see what John used to be like before he started trying to be a good person.  Like I was expecting them to be like something out of Blood Meridian. Just these thoroughly unpleasant ruthless killers led by a hypocrite using philosophy to justify killing and robbing.', 'I don\'t know why we should imagine a bunch of cutthroats.  John stated how Dutch gave him a life, educated him and took care of him in his youth. And even at the end of the journey, he kept some kind of adoration for the man, and he still considers that most of his morales and values come from what he was taught by Dutch. Even after the very end of this downfall, there\'s still that glimpse.  I hardly see ""lowlifes"" do that, so the whole ""family"" stuff, or Dutch persona, wasn\'t a surprise at all.', 'I had no idea there would be other women besides Abigail. I knew about the 4 from RDR1, plus I figured 2 or 3 more, and Abigail was the one woman.', 'I didn’t expect Dutch to be so clean looking when I saw the trailers for RDR2.', 'A whole lot fewer of them, and I imagined John being more central to the gang.', 'Yeah rdr1 painted a more realistic picture of the gang for the time period. A lot more griddier and nasty for an outlaw gang. The pinkertons even called Dutch a rapist in the first game. The 2nd game they behaved more intelligent and modern mannered for thieves and killers.', 'I imagined John and Bill had a love/hate relationship with each other and that they both competed for Dutch’s respect. I think Bill mentions Dutch everytime he talks to John in RDR1 so I figured he really looked up to Dutch. I also imagined they were just a gang of a couple cunning theives with no women aside from Abigail and definitely no people who didn’t do too much like Reverend or Uncle.', ""I thought they'd be nastier.  The way John describes the gang and himself, is they were incredibly bad people - John's wake up call was being left for dead, not the ferry job.  John by RDR1 doesn't even remember the Blackwater Ferry heist, but in RDR2 Rockstar changed it all.  The gang were always soft hearted idealists who wanted to be free, the Ferry job was inflated to be a MASSIVE event and the entire plot revolves around it. I never got a sense John likes the gang at all, just Abigail.  Bill may be a mean idiot, but Javier is downright nice.  Not true to their portrayals at all in RDR1. Bill is skinning people alive in the first game man.""]"

Adizero SL- their version of the Nike Pegasus. On the cheaper side, no rods or torsion system. Mainly lightstrike 2.0, with a small puck of lightstrike pro under the forefoot  Boston 12- higher tier trainer. Again,  lightstrike 2.0 in the heel, lightstrike pro under the forefoot with fiberglass rods. Can use it as a daily trainer, speed shoe, race shoe if you're ok with the weight. Etc. Basically a training companion for the Pro 3  Takumi Sen- lowish stack racing shoe. All lightstrike pro with fiberglass rods. Think of it as your either 5k/10k racer or a speed shoe for shorter efforts. Some could probably take it to the half marathon if they're ok with the stack.   Pro 3- the half-full marathon racing shoe. All lightstrike pro, carbon rods.   PXS- their above 40mm training/racing shoe (whatever you want to call it). All lightstrike pro, one layer of carbon rods, half layer of carbon blades under that."", 'Can someone do this as for all shoe company line ups?', 'I hesitate between the Takumi Sen and Adios.

The Adios is more old school, low stack, non-plated.   Adizero SL and Boston 12: Daily trainers, do it all. The Boston is more premium as it uses the energy rods and Lightstrike Pro.   Adios Pro 3: race day shoe, marathon and half marathon  Prime X 2: Max cushion shoe that swims against the current. It likes to go fast instead of going slow for easy long runs as all other max cushion shoes do  Ultraboost Light: Max cushion shoe designed for slow and easy miles', 'First:  ignor everything not in the Adizero line  SL - stands for so long.  As in, all your runs will feel so long in these.  Safely skip.    Adios 8:  racing flat.  Low stack and light , but advance foam mix with updates LS2 and LS pro up front plus a torsion plate for stability.  Good for work outs. Nice more stable alternative to TS.  Low mile daily trainer.    TS9:  Higher stack “racing flat”.  A departure from its heritage but oh what a departure.  100%  light strike pro with nylon rods.  Not stable!  But oh so fun to run!  Would not use as a daily shoe.  Break out when you want to go fast fast fast.  Good for 5-10K.  Some people will run 1/2 marathon up, but probably better options for that.  ONLY for narrow footed, do not attempt with wide feet.    Boston 12:  don’t have but my sense is a well cushioned shoe for high mileage training.  Not the fastest shoe out there, but a 3:30+ marathoner probably wouldn’t care that much.  Not really a race shoe but all rounder you could race in if you wanted.  If I were a Clydesdale I would probably look more closely at these.  Adios Pro 8 - the official race day shoe.  Good for any distance.  Carbon fiber rods + deep stack.  Not the best daily trainer, but maybe break out 1/week on you long day.    PrimeX - built for aliens (rich aliens because at 300 a pop…) .  I couldn’t run in these if I tried.  Super high stack, not technically race legal (but unless you’re a podium placer who cares).  If I were a super neutral long runner these might be interesting to me at half price.  Greta looking upper.  Super envious of Strung uppers.  Maybe someday they’ll filter down.  Until then I’ll admire from a distance.']"

Some reasons why, not in any particular order:  1. Strait isn’t small - about 2 miles (3km) 2. Strait is deep (820 ft or so; 250m).  That would make for LONG pylons, also means any bending moment (think wind, water) would tend to put a huge amount if stress on the pylons.  10 years or so ago, they were looking at two large pylons, each 382m tall (around 1300 feet or so).  Those would be massive structures.  And building at 250m+ depth in water isn’t a cakewalk either. 3. Strait has massive water exchange.  Linked to origins if Scylla and Charybdis legend.  That phenomenal amount of water going back and forth exacerbates the load on the supports. 4.  Huge amount of local ecosystems in that area.  Considering that most pylons taper outwards as they go down, this would probably mean destruction of local ecosystems on a rather massive scale. 5.  Huge amount of bird migration through that area.  Not exactly fun to drive/design to.  Nesting places, feeding etc all needs to be seen to. 6.  Active geological area. 7.  Initial cost estimate was 6.1 billion.  Presumably doubled since then.', 'This is just connecting two very unproductive areas where the economic benefits don’t vastly outweigh the costs so it’s gotten put on the back burner to more profitable projects', 'charybdis wont sell', 'Because Italy doesn’t give a fuck about southern Italy, nor Sicily', 'The straight at Messina is very deep', ""The people here have no idea what the fuck they're talking about.   Basically the biggest issue is that Sicily and mainland Italy literally sit on seperate continental plates. Meaning earthquakes are frequent, and both landmasses are moving relative to each other."", 'It depends on what type of bridge you’re going for here. The Kerch bridge is a multi span concrete girder bridge for the majority of the spans. Something like this would be more akin to the Golden Gate Bridge in that it would have to be a very large Suspension or Cable Stayed bridge. These specifically can handle long spans via their cables into the piers. Speaking of piers, these would have to be deep and tall. You’re talking about a span of 1.5 km minimum being supported by a single pier which is a long distance. These would have to be massive. Earthquake/seismic forces in the region are large making the design more difficult but a known problem. Now here’s the kicker: contractors have to be able to build the bridge. It will require a massive effort and very very careful planning in order to make this work. Given this is my profession: I’m glad I am not doing this project. It’s ambitious and very difficult, but it’s not impossible. Bottom line will be cost', ""The 'Ndrangheta"", 'A number of reasons, but family in the area tell me that the current ferry situation is mostly ran by mafia and dodgy people, supposedly they pay alot for the bridge to always have some issue that stops it being constructed, if you take a train to Sicily from mainland, they literally dismantle it and put it on a ferry… so ye, i don’t think local interests want it built.  One of the other issues is infrastructure on either side of the supposed bridge. You can build a bridge but its very hard to actually go anywhere afterwards as the highways aren’t particularly large or functional, so they also need to build those up as well.   Then the strait itself is very active with a volcano not far and earthquakes, the strait is also very deep, the south is not very economically prosperous so all in all its become an expensive issue that many governments simply don’t have the political capital to spend on it. I know Sicilians who don’t even want it, they want functional highways or roads instead for example.', 'Fault line and one of the most active volcanos right there. Plus corruption', 'It is sad to read so many people answering ""mafia"" or ""it is useless to link unproductive lands"", especially because infrastructures are on one of the main driver of development and productivity. It is true: today these lands are strongly underdeveloped compared to most of Western Europe; but is the lack of infrastructure a cause or rather an effect?  Sicily has been one of the most developed regions in the world since the greek age (the age of Syracuse and Archimedes) to the 13th century (the age of the German emperor Frederick II, whose royal court was in Palermo) and until the 19th century (the ""Teatro Massimo"" is still the largest opera theater in Italy).  Calabria has been the land where, probably, the words *Mathematikos* and *Philosophia* were born, and still in the 1860 there was a decent industrial output (e.g. in Mongiana, even though already less than in the north of Italy).  After a few centuries of domination by foreign countries, and even more after reunification of Italy (someone would say ""after invasion of the Kingdom of the two Sicilies by the Kingdom of Sardinia""), the development of infrastructures in the south has been very poor, and this is also the cause, not only the effect, of the south\'s underdevelopment. The central State should build infrastructure to boost development, sending the army to control mafia\'s activity if needed.', 'Very strange considering that italian infrastructure is top tier otherwise.', 'Italian here… budget constraints, costs vs benefits (use the ferry), technical difficulties and  because of geological instability.

Same with many other stocks. But the amount of fraudulently over-leveraged, synthetic, rehypothecated, naked shorts on GME has created the biggest the idiosyncratic risk that could be the most detrimental liquidity black hole of all time to the entire financial system if it was ever allowed to be unwound. Whether you agree or not, this is a major risk to the USA economy.  2. **Geopolitics and International Risk** Under USA Primacy, the USA virtually controls the world economy and resources via US DOLLAR as world reserve currency. BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South America) nations do not like this. They want to take control away from USA.  3. **Macroeconomic Financial risk:** USA financial economy is at major risk thanks to the Federal Reserve working with the greedy banks. Decades and decades allowing for Trillions of the leveraged debt. But the leveraged debt over the past several decades is what has been able to pump our markets to infinity, allowing for more growth and development of the USA. US corporations couldn’t have grown the way it has without it. QE and low rates have allowed the USA to stay on top.  4.  **Wealth gap risk**. Concentrated wealth at the top is weakening the middle class, making USA economy weaker overall. Just another symptom to a failing economy.  5. **Social unrest, political divide risk**. Middle class is too divided. Lower class is too divided. Higher crime rates, countless public shootings. Everyone wants to point the finger and blame the other political party.

I’m leaning toward the former though, but wouldn’t be surprised if some of those have also gone against any hedgies involved which has only served to magnify their headaches on any stonk not currently approaching a delisting event.   3) I’m still not convinced on the mechanics side of the glitches. There are a lot of exchanges and data feeds out there. How many are we talking about that have shown glitches and is there any commonality to their data source? A deeper look into possible mechanics for how this would work in reality would be nice. It’s one thing to suggest titans of industry have signed away their proverbial souls to commit fraud and each survive, but another when it involves multiple IT/dev dudes manually entering static prices on feeds or changing the source URL for those feeds.   4) The Fed is filled with smart, not *completely* -inept people, so there has to be some understanding among the board that they prolong this cat-and-mouse chase of inflation to buy time for FedNow and other similar “outs” to be made ready and for consolidations to happen among their banks to pull it off. Assuming they get the timing right and pull off a workable exit that involves a new currency, we need to be ready to understand the legal and moral implications and not willingly accept a giant payday just because it’s finally being offered.   5) Hedgies would appear to be big fuk.', 'Dang Swede, that was a good read.

Germany\'s largest bank said in a note dated June 9 and viewed by Reuters that it had uncovered a shortfall in the shares that back the depositary receipts (DRs) the bank had issued before the Ukraine invasion. The shares have been held in Russia by a different depositary bank.      In the circular, Deutsche attributed the shortfall to a decision by Moscow to allow investors to convert some of the DRs into local stock. The conversion was carried out without the German bank\'s ""involvement or oversight"" and Deutsche was unable to reconcile the company shares with the depositary receipts.      It is the first major bank to formally inform depositary receipt holders that they may not get take ownership of precisely all the shares they are entitled to, two sources advising investors who continue to hold Russian DRs told Reuters.      DRs are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange. Swapping DRs for shares in the Russian company is a first step towards an effort to recover their money.      Shares affected include those in national airline Aeroflot\xa0(AFLT.MM), construction firm LSR Group\xa0(LSRG.MM), mining and steel firm Mechel\xa0(MTLR.MM)\xa0and Novolipetsk Steel\xa0(NLMK.MM). Mechel declined to comment, while the remaining companies did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comments.      Western sanctions and Russian countermeasures have stranded assets held by citizens and companies on both sides of the political divide. Moscow is also demanding a 10% contribution to the federal budget, termed an ""exit tax"" by Washington.      The Kremlin has also taken assets under temporary control, seizing the Russian subsidiaries of two European energy firms in April, underscoring a strategy to lessen foreign influence on companies critical of its economic and political interests.         A significant number of investors ranging from small hedge funds to big global asset managers still hold depositary receipts, investor sources said.      Most investors have marked down Russian assets to zero but some still harbour hopes of recovering value in the future.      Irina Tsukerman, president at geopolitical risk consultancy Scarab Rising, said the news should come as no surprise.       ""Literally everything in Russia has been vulnerable, whether its these DRs, equities, real estate or any other form of financial asset,"" she told Reuters.      The Central Bank of Russia did not immediately comment on the matter.      Russia\'s National Settlement Depository said the conversion of shares had been carried out in accordance with Russian legislation and that it was not the accounting institution responsible for implementing this mechanism.      #\'COMPLETE CHAOS\'      Lawyers and other advisers have described the conversion process as ""complete chaos"".      ""To a certain extent, this resulted in double counting because, without a reconciliation between Russia and foreign banks, an investor could get Russian shares and still hold the DRs at the foreign bank,"" said Grigory Marinichev, a partner at law firm Morgan Lewis.      Deutsche Bank is now allowing investors to swap DRs for shares as part of its plans to exit all Russia business, one source said.      The bank also determined that clients could be in a better position if they could convert their DRs at least partially, this person added.      JPMorgan & Chase\xa0(JPM.N), Citigroup\xa0(C.N)\xa0and BNY Mellon\xa0(BK.N)\xa0act as depositary banks for most other Russian depositary receipt programs, according to Clearstream.      All three banks declined to comment on whether they had also identified shortfalls, but their books remain closed due to the challenges with reconciliation, according to statements on their websites.      Deutsche said in its circular that if it was able to reconcile its books at a later date, then it would look to return more shares to their rightful owners.      But it cautioned that the net proceeds from sales of shares it was able to return to investors would likely be ""substantially lower"" than the current market price.  The bank said it understood Russia\'s Government Commission for Control over Foreign Investments required that such shares be sold ""at a discount of at least 50% from their appraised market value,"" the circular said.', ""Lol foreign investors get rugpulled having entitlements instead of direct ownership when locals beat them to the company ledger?

After a couple years of these childhood antics, mom and grandma concocted a plan to exact their revenge. It started by then taking us to Chuck E. Cheese.  First they had us burn off our energy by giving us each a $10 roll of quarters for the games.They then got us doped up on pizza and soda. The second part of their plan was the most sinister. They gave us coloring books and markers for the drive home so we were thoroughly distracted. Then came the moment of revenge… all of a sudden my friend and I were jolted by a flurry of punches and a cacophony of women yelling every color imaginable… the pummeling only lasted a minute but the trauma left us reeling and in shock, unable to comprehend what had just happened. Turns out, they had used the ploy of taking us to Chuck E. Cheese and an innocent excuse to drive out of town… and one the way back stopped in a Volkswagen salvage yard that had hundreds of beetles. They revenge was perfect in its planning and execution. Such a beautiful thing when your mom and grandma conspire to such lengths to exact vengeance.  Haven’t thought about that one in a while.

Regarding international transffer, like others said, in our family we use money wise (also great to have it for when and if you go on vacation in countries with non Euro currencies).   Tips from my own experience:   Check how many local branches and partner ATMs with 0 fee cash withdrawal are in your area. Other than that, check their weekly/monthly maximum cap withdrawals/payments to see if their fit your needs. (Especially for things such as buying a car, furniture, etc).  Also keep in mind that when paying for rent to your landlord, if outside of Commerzbank, without a 1.5 Euro fee it can take 24-48 hours for the payment to process. In my case to avoid this I transfer on working days 48 hours before due date just to be safe (but here it might just be my own paranoia).  Card quality:  I had to request 3 new cards and my gf 2 (which is done easily via app and comes fast by post), in a 5 year period. This was due to the poor quality of the cards (materials) themselves which cracked or got faded to the point of not being able to be read by devices. The current one already shows signs of cracking/chipping on the sides.', ""I've been using it as my main bank for the last 3 years since I moved to Germany. My wife and all her family use Sparkasse, this makes it a bit more difficult when transferring money from me to them but not the other way.  Not sure if there are other offers but it sucks that I can't make a real time transfer without paying extra. My wife always send real time transfers from her Sparkasse and there are no extra charges.  Also the Commerzbank mobile app is a bit behind I'd say, sometimes it doesn't work, sometimes it doesn't update the actual money you have left until you do an extra restart of the app (probably some caching issues).  I like that you can get a Google pay visa virtual card. From what I know Sparkasse offers only EC virtual cards, or just my wife has that 😅.  Anyway, in conclusion I think they have much to work still in order to make it an acceptable experience, had some attempts to switch over to Sparkasse but I never fully committed. Currently I just use it as little as possible to pay my rent and otherwise I'm paying everything I can with klarna.""]"

Dass die Telekom Schuld sein soll, steht indes außer Frage. Wie passt das zusammen? * Eingeräumt wurde, dass anstatt der vorgeschriebenen ersten TAE-Dose mit passivem Prüfabstand einfach das Kabel aus der Wand kommt und von Vaddern mit einem Stecker versehen wurde. Auch das entsprechende Signaturkabel kann so nicht verwendet werden. Das ist Pfusch und entspricht nicht den Vorgaben der Telekom. Somit ist der Anschluss auch nicht vernünftig diagnostizierbar. Man braucht sich also nicht wundern, wenn die Hotline keine Auskunft geben kann. * Ein Techniker wird nicht ins Haus gelassen, vermutlich, weil er die zusammengeschusterte Leitung nicht sehen soll.  Vermutung: Der Fehler liegt mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit an einer völlig verpfuschten bzw. unzulässigen Hausverkabelung, was bei Super-Vectoring-Anschlüssen eben häufig zu Problemen führt. Aber Hauptsache erst mal ordentlich Telekom-Bashing betreiben. Äußerst dubios, das Ganze.  \\---  Ich sehe du benutzt eine FRITZ!Box 7590. Könntest du mal einen Screenshot der DSL-Informationen und des Spektrums posten? Das ist wesentlich aussagekräftiger als der Speedtest.

Möglich wäre eine fehlerhafte Hausverkabelung oder ein älteres Powerline-Gerät. Die stören bei Supervectoring gerne mal.  Sofern du eine Ursache bei dir im Haus ausschließen kannst, würde ich einfach online eine Störung melden. Das geht dann seinen Gang. Wesentlich schnellere und kompetentere Hilfe als an der Hotline bekommt man außerdem oft im Telekom hilft-Forum. Sollte tatsächlich keine höhere Datenrate an deinem Anschluss möglich sein, würde ich von meinem Widerrufsrecht Gebrauch machen. Da wird sich auch niemand querstellen.  PS: Die Telekom ist besser als ihr Ruf. Bei anderen läuft es auch nicht besser, teilweise sogar erheblich schlechter. Man kann nicht immer aufgrund von Einzelfällen pauschalisieren. Nirgends läuft alles perfekt.']"

Finalmente um tópico em que posso comentar, Pois trabalho na área… vários pontos: 1) a marca Colgate não pertence à Unilever 🤭 2) quem define os preços de venda ao público são os retalhistas (continente, pingo doce ou mercearia da esquina)… o fabricante normalmente faz uma recomendação, mas o retalhista é quem decide se vende o produto A ou o B e a que preço. 3) não conheço bem o mercado Alemão, mas assumindo que será parecido a Espanha onde trabalho actualmente, efectivamente o mesmo producto pode ter um preço de prateleira significativamente superior em PT vs Espanha, e isto deve-se principalmente às mecânicas promocionais num e noutro mercado. Em Espanha apenas um 10-20% dos productos de marca se vendem em promoção e a profundidade promocional máxima em Espanha é de 30% , só aplicável quando compras 3 unidades (ou seja tens que comprar 3 pastas de dentes Colgate a 3€ cada uma para teres um desconto de 30%). Já em Portugal, na maioria das categorias em que trabalhei é normal que mais de 80% das vendas se faça em promoção e o nível de desconto médio é pelo menos de 50% sem compra mínima. Ou seja a mesma pasta de dentes em Portugal tem um preço de prateleira de 4,50€ mas mais de 80% das vezes vende-se a 2,25€. Olhando para preços médios (con promoção) é falso que o mesmo producto seja muito mais caro em Portugal vs Espanha. 4) márgens - de todas as categorias que trabalhei… as margens de fabricantes e retalhistas em Portugal e Espanha são bastante parecidas. Nunca vi diferenças superiores a +/- 5%, pois apesar de o preço inicial ser diferente, em Portugal precisas de oferecer mais descontos para vender 5) marcas fabricante vs “marcas brancas” - não acredito que umas sejam boas e as outras más. Simplesmente têm papéis diferentes. As marcas de fabricantes normalmente são responsáveis por criar inovação, oferecer mais valor (benefícios adicionais) e fazer crescer as categorias. Já as marcas brancas oferecem um serviço normalmente mais básico em categorias maduras, ajudando a limitar e a ajustar os preços de mercado através da concorrência… dou um exemplo: há uns anos trabalhei num projecto para lançar pensos higiénicos em alguns países africanos, onde muitas mulheres não sabem sequer da existência de estes productos. Para isso tivemos que investir muito dinheiro em publicidade (= educação sobre os benefícios de um penso higiénico vs não usar qualquer absorvente menstrual) e na abertura de canais comerciais. Obviamente, para fazer este trabalho a marca para a qual trabalhava precisa ter um preço de venda que financie estes custos, diferente de uma marca branca que não faz qualquer publicidade e entra apenas em categorias com muitos utilizadores, e normalmente com uma tecnologia de producto 4 ou 5 anos atrasada vs as marcas de fabricante, daí conseguir oferecer produtos mais baratos. Voltando ao exemplo… a Colgate vende a sua melhor tecnologia de pasta de dentes 4,50€ para financiar o desenvolvimento de novos productos ou até programas de educação para que todas as crianças entendam a importância de lavar os dentes. Depois provavelmente até oferece ao Continente, a sua tecnologia de produto de há 10 anos atrás, para que eles vendam sob a marca Continente a um preço mais baixo e assim democratizar ainda mais o acesso a esta categoria.  Resumindo e reforçando alguns comentários em cima, os consumidores têm todo o poder. Se todos estamos contentes com a tecnologia de pasta de dentes da Colgate de ha 10 anos atrás, devemos comprar pasta de dentes marca branca, mais barata, e o mais provável é que está categoria não tenha muito mais inovação no futuro e que empresas privadas deixem de investir em publicidade/ projectos de educação a jovens sobre como lavar os dentes… se pelo contrário comprarmos mais pasta de dentes da Colgate, provavelmente a empresa terá mais dinheiro para investir em publicidade, desenvolvimento de novos productos, educação nas escolas etc e as gerações vindouras terão uma melhor saúde bucal 😉  Nota: nunca trabalhei na Colgate ou com pastas de dentes, mas lembro-me de na escola primária (há mais de 20 anos) ter uma aula de higiene bucal patrocinada pela Colgate (alguém teve que comprar Colgate e não marca branca, para que eles há 20 anos fizessem isso 😅)  Nota final: há várias marcas brancas cuja margem de lucro é superior a marcas de fabricante apesar de serem mais baratas… simplesmente o modelo de negócio é diferente. nao é só o preço que devemos ter em conta, mas sim que valor/benefícios nos oferece cada marca/producto. Passa-se exactamente o mesmo que com automóveis/casas/telemóveis ou qualquer outro producto… podemos comprar um Dacia ou um Mercedes.. os dois tem 4 rodas 😉', 'Faz todo o sentido que seja assim. Eu já soube dum exemplo algo parecido. Uma das primeiras empresas a lançar colchões com aquele topping de espuma de memória decidiu fazer o lançamento no Harrods e colocou um preço abaixo dos concorrentes. Não venderam quase nada… em vez de desistir, colocaram lá um vendedor para fazer estudo de mercado a quem experimentava o colchão e porque é que não comprava. Descobriram que as pessoas não confiavam na qualidade por causa do preço.   A empresa retirou os colchões, criou um novo nome para os colchões da gama alta, subiu consideravelmente o preço e voltaram à carga, desta vez com sucesso.

Highlight of the day la el era ca ridica pods pentru restul echipei. Alta tot din DB a venit obosita (sau drogata suspectez eu) în interviu. Nivelul tehnic dezastru, iar corporateza aia cu multe cuvinte fara sa spui nimic era la cote maxime. Stiu si 2 devi care au plecat în DB.

Im Klimaschutz gibt es keinen Kompromiss, entweder richtig oder es sterben Mrd Menschen. Das 1,5°C Ziel ist der maximale ""Kompromiss"". Die Kohle unter Lützerath reicht damit Deutschland seine Klimaziele komplett verfehlt. Siehe frontal (ÖRR). Diese titelte am 18.1.23 das nur noch 2 bis 3 Jahre die Kohlekraft genutzt werden darf für 1,5°C Ziel.  3. Die Polizei hat ein recht auf Dienstverweigerung. Kein Bulle muss diese Befehle ausführen. Keiner muss da sein!  4. Der einzige Grund warum Lützerath fällt sind die Profitinteressen RWEs. Da weder Klimaschutz der Grund ist (Siehe Punkt 2) noch für die Energieversorgung gebraucht wird (siehe Punkt 1). Dies halte ich für verfehrlich und Wiederstand dagegen ist komplett gerechtfertigt.  5. ""RWE hat aber das juristischen Recht zur Räumung"" Ja in der Theorie.

I did not expect this comment to blow up like that.   For clarification, Zyklon (A) gas was originally invented in it’s contemporary form, by Fritz Haber, a Jewish German nationalist in 1922, as a result of his work at a German consortium formed to study potential Military uses of Hydrogen Cyanide. Zyklon was created, marketed as a pesticide, and later banned as a similar gas had been used as a weapon in WWI. Haber was banished by the Germans in 1933, as a result of his Jewish descent. He died in 1934.   Zyklon B was later developed by removing the cautionary eye irritant. This version was used in Germany, as well as developed in the U.S. under license and used in the 1930s to fumigate freight cars as well as the clothing of Mexican immigrants entering the U.S.   It’s use in the Holocaust was mainly perpetrated by IG Farben, a conglomerate of 6 German companies, one of which was Bayer. IG Farben notoriously used slave labor to conduct operations in Germany. And Bayer employees performed medical experiments on captured Jews. Most of whom died as a result. After WWII, IG Farben was split by the Allies back into its component companies. One of which was Bayer, now known as Bayer AG. Fritz ter Meer, a member of the board at IG Farben, was involved in the planning of multiple Nazi extermination camps, and was tried at the Nuremberg Trials. And was sentenced to 7 years in prison, although he was released in 1951.

I'm currently researching forced labor in Nazi Germany because I'm trying to figure out what happened to my great-uncle. He was a Dutch forced laborer, arrested in the Netherlands after an altercation with the Germans during the occupation. He involuntarily accepted work in Aachen for the construction company Derichs und Konertz but was brought to prison in Aachen by the Gestapo for refusing to work. He was sent to Niederhagen-Wewelsburg camp, and later to Sachsenhausen where he died on the 13th of June 1943. He was 23 years old.   A man from the same town was also brought to prison for work refusal, but already spend a year in Germany as a forced laborer in the IG Farben plants at Griesveld and Hoechst. This man miraculously survived the war but dealt with trauma and health issues until his death.  The book I'm using for my research is 'Das nationalsozialistische Lagersystem' and it lists around 2500 companies that used forced labor during the war.

611,z3f1th,2022-11-24 09:57:59,Dealing with Fresenius,19,All,Fresenius,"[""I worked as a dialysis tech for 5 years and have been a dialysis RN for 9 months. I will tell you, the current situation with our country's job market is more than likely part of the issue. Lots of staff in clinics have left for less intense, better paying jobs. It's difficult when there are no seasoned staff at the clinic. Unfortunately, being in a rural community it is probably even worse. I think the best advice would be to ask about doing home hemo. There is a nexstage machine that is rather small. Your mom would need room in her home for some supplies, the machine, access to water and a drain. A plumber comes out and creates the necessary connections, after a home inspection by the home HD nurse and clearance from the medical director for your mom to do home hemo. Then she would train how to work the machine, how to self-cannulate, troubleshooting, etc. I think this would probably be your best option. And she would be able to use the vein finder you purchased. If you have any questions you can send me a message."", '> He told me that infiltrations are 99% preventable and speaks to the skill and competency of the nursing team.    Interesting that there are so many nurses at the Howard University Hospital. Here at my Fresenius clinic, there\'s usually one nurse (who gives IV Iron and Vitamin D) while the Patient Care Technicians mostly cannulate fistulas.    But I 100% can attest to the fact that it\'s down to the skill of the person cannulating you. Even when the fistula is new, a very skilled tech can 100% avoid infiltrations and hematomas.    Personally, I got tired of dealing with that, so I started taking [this](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FC6VUQ/). It\'s high blood pressure medication, like Losartan or Lisinopril. It widens all blood vessels, so it makes it easier for them to cannulate my fistula. I\'ve never got a hematoma again after taking that. If she does take that, I recommend taking it before eating, because it does cause a temporary increase in potassium levels, which insulin from your pancreas will fix, and insulin is produced in response to eating food. Basically, it causes potassium to be released from the cells, and the insulin shuffles the potassium back into the cells.   > If they do not agree, what are some other options? There is no other provider in her area. If they don\'t agree, I\'m tempted to threaten a malpractice lawsuit. Can they drop her as a patient or are they legally required to serve her?  I wouldn\'t rush to a malpractice lawsuit. A patient has certain rights, including ""Receive high-quality healthcare that meets recognized professional goals.""     There\'s a formal grievance process:    https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/dial_billofrights    > Additionally, you should know that there is a process if you have concerns, complaints, or grievances. The first step is to speak with someone on your healthcare team at the dialysis unit. You may wish to elevate your concern to clinic management or your nephrologist, although any member of your dialysis care team can listen to your grievance (complaint) and start the formal grievance process.   >   > If you feel that your concern has not been effectively dealt with by your healthcare team at the dialysis clinic, then you can call the Patient Advocate at your local ESRD Network.  [Click here to find your local ESRD Network contact information.](http://esrdnetworks.org/membership/esrd-networks)  You can also learn more about the formal grievance process through [this Grievance Toolkit designed by patients.](http://esrdnetworks.org/resources/toolkits/patient-toolkits/dialysis-patient-grievance-toolkit-1)', 'Hi! Dialysis nurse/previous dialysis tech/expert cannulator jumping in. Based on everything you’ve laid out, please consider looking into home therapy for your mom. Staff in the current workforce are few and far between, especially experienced ones. I don’t mean this in a negative way: but if you are unhappy with her care and think you can do it better yourself, then consider it. Home therapies is a great option in rural areas especially because it limits weekly travel as well.

A needle gets inserted in the same spot 5 or 6 treatments in a row. This creates a ""tunnel"" through the skin. Then they use dull needles that will not cut holes to cannulate through those tunnels. Side benefit is very little pain.   Some nephrologists are against buttonholes because they can lead to infection easier. As long as you keep the area clean or covered between treatments it\'s not that big of a deal.   I\'ve been on hemo for 5+ years and had buttonholes for about 3 of them. I do home hemo for the last 2 years.   Perhaps with the buttonholes your mother wouldn\'t be scared or unwilling to cannulate herself and could become a candidate for home treatment.   One caveat...

Well that never happened so I learned how to stick myself! You have the right to advocate for yourself and say enough is enough they are are life lines by the way! I do home hemo now because of incompetence at my dialysis clinic, I don’t know if this is an option for you?

Siemens dominates, while AB dominates the USA.', 'They are quite good in my opinion. I prefer them to Allen-Bradley or Schneider, the other brands I’ve used.', ""A lot can be said about Siemens. The IDE licenses are expensive, the hardware is expensive for what it is, there are artificial limitations, some things are kind of clunky, et.c.  But there definitely are some upsides, especially if you're supposed to run and maintain that system 15-20 years down the line. If I'm rocking up to a unknown existing system running, say, an S7-300 from 2005 I'm very certain I can work on it and do an online change, no problem.  A system from 2005 running TwinCAT or some flavour of Codesys? Not so much without having either the ancient laptop that did the last download, or doing some **extensive** tinkering with IDE versions, library versions et.c., and I'm still not going to be confident doing an online change.  This sub is heavily skewed towards integrators/developers that mostly work on new and shiny stuff, I feel. My thoughts in the back of my head is always how it's going to work in practice 10+ years from now, but that's my reality, lol"", ""Oh man, so...I personally prefer Allen Bradley over Siemens, but I know both.  That being said, Siemens is very good as a PLC brand, right on par with Allen Bradley, with some things better and some things worse.  Tag handling is a bit more confusing in Siemens, as well as keeping subroutines active with nothing in them.  Their safety side has a lot to be desired too, but they're improving it every year.  But it's by no means a bad PLC brand."", 'It’s all 1’s and 0’s. If my customer wants Siemens, I program in TIA. If they want AB, I program in Rockwell. Mitsubishi…GX, GEFANUC…done, OMRON…fine, VLC…flowchart it is (yeah look that one up)  I’ll give everyone 5 minutes to bitch about which one is better. After 5, back to 1’s and 0’s.  My point is to be flexible (or flow like water as Bruce Lee would say). The core fundamentals are the same across the board.  Is _____ a bad plc brand? Nope.', 'I’ve programmed both Siemens, Allen Bradley and Schneider Electric in the past 7 years. My favorite for the visual programming languages like Ladder is by far Siemens. I prefer Schneider Electric for structured text coding, and also now that I use Siemens I miss the ability to add Methods (sub programs) to functions. They made for a much cleaner program. But Siemens is better in so many ways that I prefer Siemens today.', 'Definitely not bad,  I started on AB in school, worked primarily with Siemens professionally for 10 years, now learning codesys platform in the indraworks flavor.  Each one has its own flavor to accomplish the same types of things. Some make certain things easier than others.  It can definitely be difficult at first changing from one platform to another, task scheduling really threw me for a loop.', ""A large portion of the folks in this sub are from the US, where Rockwell is king, and they've mostly trained users to have very different expectations of how a PLC should be used than what a lot of other brands do.  They can get a bit pokey about it; it's kinda like calling a rival sports team the worst.  It doesn't actually mean they're bad, it often just means you don't want them to be good.  Every brand has a HW issue here and there, but I'd say Siemens is at least as good as anybody for reliability.  From a performance and capabilities perspective, Siemens can do pretty much anything.  They charge you for it tho.  From a SW side, there are a ton of legit gripes out there (WHY DO I NEED TO HAVE SO MANY VERSIONS INSTALLED IN PARALLEL AND AN ELEPHANT LOAD OF RAM) but they also do a lot of things well, and they definitely make an effort to be on the front of technology trends as opposed to just waiting to see how things play out.  At the end of the day, you're in Europe, Siemens is the biggest name in the area, it's good experience for you."", 'Probably the best, with all things considered.', 'I am also from Spain, I was also a student.  Already in the field I have faced several brands of PLCS and I can tell you that if you compare Siemens with the rest....for me Siemens wins, maybe ab is the same or better but I have not used it enough to give an opinion.  Also the opinion depends a lot on your experiences with the plc and with which brand you started to program.  For me personally, Tia portal seems to me the best ui/ux to program plcs It allows you a lot of flexibility when it comes to programming and it is quite easy to reuse code, functions, user data types, etc... but it is not perfect like any other.  in my field 95% of the plcs that i come across are siemens or omrom', ""I don't like them charge way too much for tech support on obsolete items as well as not answering the questions asked I prefer automationdirects productivity 2000 program and tech support is free"", 'No…', 'I used Mitsubishi, AB , Siemens, Schneider, Omron and for me Siemens and AB are at the top.', 'In my opinion Siemens is the best if you take it all the way with Siemens. PLC, HMI, VFD etc. It’s very robust and works great together.  A downside is that their VFD, sensors etc are mad expensive compared to others. But just for the PLC there are better options that gives more power for the money and easier complex functionality.', 'Well, if the view is with the aspect of traditional programming language then no difference between each other. In terms of advance programming language and easiness of programming, I\'d say siemens might have an edge, they have CFC, SCL and safety matrix that a plant process would benefit a lot (depends on the depth of knowledge to use it). Where as to other brands they do have also edge by developing their own kinds of advance programming language. As to others who stays in LAD, FBD, STL and Sequencers then they might say ""this"" brand of plc is better and that is because they are used to it and mastered it. As to others who have/had the chance to see or experience the difference between traditional and the advance programming they should be the ones and could perhaps identifies who has an edge over the others in terms of different aspects of the PLC be software, hardware, and etc. as the basis.   For me, it really depends on the end user\'s knowledge of the product.', 'Yes. Their software is bloated, slow, buggy, and frankly convoluted. Their products are limiting. While I have only ever used Siemens products, I can genuinely tell you that they are an absolute nightmare to work with.', 'Its more of a question which system they are used to. Siemens is a good one, what i have seen from alot of integrators is that they apply the same programming structures as for example rockwell causing the plc to be slower than it should be. All PLC have different structures, you will just need to learn the brand.', ""The reason you see so many complaints about them is because everyone uses them.    Every PLC has things that suck about it.  It's Allen Bradley/Rockwell in America and people talk about how Siemens is the 'better' alternative."", ""I'm still studying, but I always work with Siemens and Schneider PLC's.   I personally don't like very much Siemens, but it's only because of the interface we use to program with it xD   But it's not a bad PLC brand at all, it has never failed me when it comes to liability and response."", 'Question for the guys who say that Siemens are expensive:  Are you outside of Europe? If not, where are you buying from?  In the UK we are stuck with buying AB legitimately through a single source (Routeco) which means that your price is dependant on the discount that you can barter whereas Siemens can be sourced via a number of different vendors and the prices vary wildly between them. It may pay you to shop around.', 'Siemens a bad PLC brand?  Oh god.   First of all, the quality of their products is unmatched, only Japanese will come close (Omron etc). If a Siemens PLC is operational, it will be for a long long time.  Then the price/functionality. The S7-1200 is very powerfull and cheap! Onboard Profinet, analog out, webserver, OPC-UA, high speed inputs! Tracing functionality. .csv logging, even some basic motion control (for example with pulse output or analog out).  Finally their programming environment. TIA portal is slow, but it enables you to structure your project amazingly well. Very good online/offline comparison, great trace tool, and lots of quality of life functionality like copy and past directly to/from excel.', ""It seems like whenever a huge security vulnerability is discovered in a PLC, it's Siemens. Just my two cents."", 'I personally am an Automation Direct guy myself the performance is great and for the price the value is unmatched.', ""Maybe not bad, but severely overrated. I've only ever worked with Siemens and there are so many things about their products that leave me scratching my head. Their documentation is absolute garbage (I've literally seen better from my classmates back in college), their software is bloated with a bunch of crap that leaves it slow and unresponsive at times and difficult to navigate at other times, their licensing and software installation process is crap, and their HMIs are horrid (so much so that my company is moving to a new Canadian-based company with more reliable HMIs).  In my professional opinion, they have a lot of issues that I know they will never fix. As such you either look at something else to beat your head in, or accept that you will be beating your head in a lot with Siemens."", 'Personally I don\'t like them. They\'re a widespread brand so it\'s good to know how to work with them, but I find their products to be vastly overpriced and cumbersome to use, with people sticking to them out of habit rather than any actual benefits.  Easiest example being that WAGO straight up made us an offer of ""we\'ll provide you with a PLC system that performs the same as your current S7-1200 setup at 75% the price"". Yeah no, what they provided us with is actually leagues more capable and easier to use.  Anytime a client requests anything memory or CPU intensive with Siemens an issue comes up of ""will it even be possible to make it fit?"" (you could say we should use one of their more powerful PLCs, but again other companies manage just fine for the same or lower price). We didn\'t find them any more reliable either, they still develop issues over time (most commonly just slowing down to the point they can\'t execute everything in time anymore). Are they easier to integrate with other products? Many producers have specials protocols etc. to cooperate with Siemens, but those have caused issues for me time and time again compared to PLCs that just follow more common standards.  I\'ve worked with some older or budget PLCs and those have definitely been worse, but I legitimately don\'t get why Siemens is the industry standard other than being the standard PLC used when teaching new automation engineers.', 'Bad to the bone!']"

Da haben irgendwelche Leute irgendwelche zahlen rausgesucht und dann irgendwas gerechnet ohne zu hinterfragen was sie da tun. Außerdem hänge ich mich an der Aussage auf, dass Norwegen seine Speicher selbst braucht. Das klingt sinnvoll, wenn man wie ein Boomer denkt dass jeder Staat sein eigenes Süppchen kocht, aber das ist in der Energiewirtschaft nicht der Fall. Daher nutzen wir jetzt schon die Speicher in Norwegen und werden sie in Zukunft noch intensiver nutzen, sobald die nächsten HGÜs nach Skandinavien am Netz sind. Richtig ist aber, dass die nicht ausreichen. Wir haben nunmal ein europäisches Verbundnetz und das ist gut so da muss jeder seinen Teil zu beitragen, sonst wird's teuer.  Zur Erklärung:  Die benötigte Speicherkapazität bemisst sich aus der prognostizierten Last des Energienetzes minus der eingespeisten Energie. Geht man von einer rein deutschen Lösung mit nur erneuerbaren aus, dann wäre es also Quatsch, dass ein halbes Jahr lang nirgendwo in DE Wind weht oder die Sonne scheint. Legt man die Speicher realistischer aus, dann bräuchte man nur genug Speicher um das Defizit aus Netzlast und Energieerzeugung der Sonnenlosesten Windfreisten Tage zu überbrücken.

Red Dead and Red Dead 2 both share a common thing of the old west dying and industrialization taking over, with stories taking place over the course of several years. The only way to keep that theme going would be to wind the clocks back further, and explore that theme from another angle. There is so much lore that’s talked about in Red Dead 2, like the year when John left the gang, Arthur having a child, etc. that all feed into this theme that the outlaw life is inescapable, and I think would be so great to see it from another perspective within the Van Der Linde gang during a time before the old west starts to truly disappear.']"

Photos from Tom Edwards (BBC London) & Geoff Marshall on Twitter. Londoners, what do you think!?",1639,All,Siemens,"['Here are a few comments about the 2024 stock / mockup in general:  The trains will have open-gangways (i.e. walk-through carriages), and reportedly air-conditioning. Whether that is full air-conditioning or air cooling remains to be seen, but I, like many others, am holding my breath for air-conditioning. Air-conditioning should mean the trains themselves are much cooler leading to much more pleasant rides, but it may make stations hotter unless further ventilation improvements are being undertaken (they should be - the Knightsbridge station upgrade is being completed, and the Holborn station upgrade should be going ahead), as the heat has to go somewhere.  The windows are small even for a tube train - this appears to be a result of Siemens engineering in a solution for the air-conditioning system, as the large ""columns"" between the windows contain vents for this system, but it\'s a reasonable trade-off to get air-conditioning.  Interestingly, concepts and this mockup both show the interior using white lighting - this is a departure from the 2009 stock and S-stock\'s use of warm yellow lighting.  An interesting design of these Siemens Inspiro London trains is that they feature \'floating carriages\' - this is where some carriages only have bogies on the one end, and the other end is left cantilevered onto the gangway of the adjacent carriage.

In these explosions 10% of the 4,500 tonnes of fertilizer stored in the silo detonated. The explosions were heard as two loud bangs in north-eastern France and in Munich, more than 300 km away, and are estimated to have contained an energy of 1–2 kilotonnes TNT equivalent.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppau_explosion  Edit: There are some more pictures, mainly used in the German version: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Oppau_explosion?uselang=en', 'Damn, a hole in the ground 62 feet deep bigger than a football field and almost 600 killed and 6000 made homeless. I had never heard of this before..', 'Did they just have no idea how dangerous ammonium nitrate is or what? Had nobody made a fertilizer bomb 100 years ago? This is some next level stupidity.  Answered my own question: > It was well known that ammonium nitrate was explosive, having been used extensively for this purpose during World War I, but tests conducted in 1919 had suggested that mixtures of ammonium sulfate and nitrate containing less than 60% nitrate would not explode. On these grounds, the material handled by the plant, nominally a 50/50 mixture, was considered stable enough to be stored in 50,000-tonne lots, more than ten times the amount involved in the disaster. Indeed, nothing extraordinary had happened during an estimated 20,000 firings, until the fateful explosion on September 21.', '>As all involved died in the explosion, the causes are not clear. However, according to modern sources and contrary to the above-mentioned 1919 tests, the ""less than 60% nitrate = safe"" criterion is inaccurate; in mixtures containing 50% nitrate, any explosion of the mixture is confined to a small volume around the initiating charge, but increasing the proportion of nitrate to 55–60% greatly increases the explosive properties and creates a mixture whose detonation is sufficiently powerful to initiate detonation in a surrounding mixture of a lower nitrate concentration which would normally be considered minimally explosive. Changes in humidity, density, particle size in the mixture and homogeneity of crystal structure also affect the explosive properties.[4][2]  >A few months before the incident, the manufacturing process had been changed in such a way as to lower the humidity level of the mixture from 3–4% to 2%, and also to lower the apparent density. Both these factors rendered the substance more likely to explode. There is also evidence that the lot in question was not of uniform composition and contained pockets of up to several dozen tonnes of mixture enriched in ammonium nitrate. It has therefore been proposed that one of the charges had been placed in or near such a pocket, exploding with sufficient violence to set off some of the surrounding lower-nitrate mixture.[4]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppau_explosion  Sounds like if there\'s anything to blame would be the recent process change without a sufficient safety analysis, although if current knowledge had not caught up at the time there\'d\'ve been no averting disaster.', ""Dude that's a great title"", 'Seems like they loosened it', 'Today, 100 years ago, was the last time ~~dynamite was used to loosen the fertilizer in the~~ BASF Oppau plant **existed.**', '""Two months earlier, at Kriewald, then part of Germany, 19 people had died when 30 tonnes of ammonium nitrate detonated under similar circumstances.

Please see comment [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/p76oxo/eastern_white_pine_tree_absolutely_oozing_sap/h9j6jql?context=3)  1) The sap was already stored in the tree.

This can happen to some softer trees (pine is very soft compared to maple or oak), after a particularly bad wind storm, think something that blows trees around a lot. The sap *is* a defense and healing mechanism, probably due to the split.  But instead of clotting (dried sap), it just kind of pooled in the cavity.

Think of it like fat storage.  Conclusion: this is part natural process that was happening anyway, combined with trying to heal an injury. The chainsaw cut just opened it up to the surface.

Based on my experience, here's what you expect:   1. **Bureaucracy** \\- Everything moves incredibly slowly at Siemens. There are tons of regulatory processes to get through. It can be a tiresome process, but you can find creative ways around it, or ways to automate these processes.  2. **Tools** \\- This company love its tools! There's a tool for everything, which is good and bad. **Good** because you are likely going to benefit from the latest and greatest tech-stack. **Bad** because some of these tools don't communicate and you might duplicate efforts. For example, we have Smartsheets, but our PMs don't, so we have to work with Excel with the PMs and Smartsheet on our own team.  3. **Advancement** \\- Given that Siemens is a massive company, you can progress very easily.  The company prefers to promote internally, and is also willing to help you get to your career goal. If you want to move laterally to another function, Siemens will help you get there. Since there's a lot of competition, though, you'll have to stand out.  4. **Resources** \\- Again, give Siemens' size, you'll have access to a wealth of resources. The company has internal training programs, but also gives you free access to LinkedIn Learning and other courses. My manager has encouraged me to take paid courses and attend conferences that interest me. 5. **Work Load** \\- This depends on your team, but expect to have very intense periods of work. This is usually followed by quieter periods, which you can use to recover or to work on other projects that interest you.    6. **Work/Life Balance** \\- Similar to #5, unfortunately. The company like to talk about being mental and physical health, but don't offer much material support. I work from home and essentially set my own schedule, but I have colleagues who work quite late. The key, as is in other companies, is to set expectations with your team from the beginning.

In other words, values are being stretched to the point of breaking, just as they were in 2007-2008 before the crisis hit.    Another issue with housing is similar to what the OP said about cars: ""Dealers by and large don’t produce ‘economy’ cars and trucks anymore. Everything is has shifted to high profit-margin vehicles"".  Similarly no one builds ""affordable"" housing.  Why?  Higher profit margins on luxury homes.  Problem is, when real estate prices decline (as the inevitably do) luxury home sales decline faster than any other price bracket.  And because the real estate market is not particularly liquid, i.e., it will take months for new inventory at lower values to be created, we end up with a glut of high end homes that have to drastically reduce their prices in order to sell, which in turn pushes down values of all other homes in the market.  Some good news: while evictions are still a looming problem, foreclosures may not be.  FHA, Fannie, and Freddie all have policies in place that will allow those coming out of forbearance to restructure and move missed payments to the end of the term, often in conjunction with a lower interest rate.

Persönliche Anekdote: Ich lote gerade für einen Verwandten die Möglichkeit aus, auf einem Stück Land (ca. 1 Hektar) eine Freiflächen-Photovoltaikanlage zu errichten.   Wäre ne richtig geile Sache, das Ding könnte optimistisch gerechnet genug Energie liefern um sein komplettes Dorf zu versorgen(!!!), gleichzeitig würde nichts von Wert verloren gehen, ökologischer Nutzen des Fleckchens ist aktuell exakt 0, landwirtschaftlicher Nutzen auch eher überschaubar, die Wiese wird aktuell als Anbaufläche für Futtergras für ne Handvoll Kühe benutzt.   Netto also ein riesiger Gewinn für die Umwelt und das Klima, bei absolut minimalem Impact für das Landschaftsbild, die Landwirtschaft oder sonstige regionale Belange.   Man sollte also meinen, so ein Vorhaben würde von den örtlichen Verantwortlichen mit Kusshand begrüßt werden, richtig?   NEIN.    Nach aktuellem Raumordnungsplan des Landes Niedersachsen sind Solarenergien *ausdrücklich nicht gewünscht*. WZF? Wie können im verfickten Jahr 2021 Solaranlagen ausdrücklich unerwünscht sein?! Selbst für die wenigen verbleibenden Flächen, auf denen solche Anlagen gemäß der unnötig strengen Kriterien wenigstens theoretisch möglich wären, ist die Umsetzung eines solchen Vorhabens unglaublich bürokratisch und so wahnsinnig kompliziert, dass man sich das Vorhaben eigentlich direkt schenken kann. Das Risiko, nach zig versenken Mannstunden und Anfangsinvestitionen doch noch auf irgendein beschissenes Detail zu stoßen, an dem das Ganze scheitert, ist einfach zu groß.  Wie kann das angehen? Die Klimakrise ist in aller Munde, selbst die CDU beginnt langsam, die Zeichen der Zeit zu kapieren, wie kann es da sein, dass etwas so indiskutabel richtiges und wichtiges wie ein Solarkraftwerk so unglaublich viele Steine in den Weg gelegt kriegt?   Die Antwort ist ganz einfach und schlägt den Bogen wieder zurück zum Anfang meines Kommentars (Stichwort Stakeholder): Bauern. Gottverfickte Bauern. Die haben nämlich einen absoluten HASS auf Photovoltaik, weil sie fürchten, dass die ihr Flächen wegnimmt, auf denen sie ihren beschissenen Monsanto-Monokulturen anbauen.

Bürokratie ist undurchsichtig, langsam, aufgeblasen, realitätsfern. Ich möchte dir jetzt gar nicht unterstellen, dass du alles auf die Bürokratie schiebst. Aber du fragst nach Vorschlägen und in diesem Punkt kann ich, glaube ich, ansetzen.  Erstmal muss man sich vielleicht mal vor Augen führen, was eigentlich Sinn und Zweck der Bürokratie (also der Verwaltung) ist: es soll Struktur geschaffen werden. Struktur ist ja weder im öffentlichen noch im privaten Sektor was schlechtes. Die Kunst besteht nur darin, eine Balance zu finden zwischen strukturierten Prozessen und Raum für Handlungsfähigkeit und Innovation.   Das Problem ist jetzt halt leider, dass die wenigsten Verwaltungen nutzerorientiert arbeiten. Sprich, es gibt ein Schema F nach welchem Entscheidungen getroffen werden und dieses Schema F wird nicht angetastet. Dabei müsste als Entscheidungsgrundlage eigentlich die Frage dienen, wen eine bestimmte Entscheidung betrifft (Stakeholderanalyse). Davon ausgehend kann dann eine Lösung erarbeitet werden, welche den betroffenen Stakeholdern am besten nützt.   * Beispiel: Forschungsprojekt an einer Uni im sozialwissenschaftlichen Bereich (es werden Personendaten erhoben). Es gibt strenge Datenschutzauflagen, was ja auch gut so ist. Es ist jetzt nicht unbedingt die Aufgabe der Forscher:innen, diese Datenschutzrichtlinien in die konkrete Durchführung des Projekts zu implementieren, sondern mein Job als Forschungskoordinator (Verwaltung). Natürlich kann ich denen jetzt ein Schema F reindrücken und das zur Vorgabe machen. Wahrscheinlich verzögert sich dadurch das Projekt, welches wegen meiner mangelnden Flexibilität angepasst werden muss. Oder aber ich nehm meinen Job ernst und entwickle eine Lösung, welche die Richtlinien implementiert ohne Einfluss auf die Methodik zu nehmen oder die Qualität der Daten verschlechtert.   Ist jetzt nur ein Beispiel aus meinem Arbeitsalltag, was aber glaube ich zeigt, wie Verwaltung und andere Bereiche eine produktive Symbiose eingehen können anstatt gegeneinander zu arbeiten. Das allein ist jetzt natürlich noch kein konkreter Verbesserungsvorschlag und das geht auch nicht von heute auf morgen.   Meiner Meinung nach ist der erste Schritt die Ausbildung. Ich hab Verwaltungswissenschaften im Ausland studiert, wo mir diese Denke ganz einfach beigebracht wird. Das muss sich vielleicht in Deutschland noch ändern, wird aber kommen.  Zweitens muss sich in vielen Sektoren die Unternehmenskultur ändern. Das ist natürlich leichter geagt als getan. Warum sollte man der Verwaltung mehr Kompetenzen zugestehen, wenn die Verwaltung komplett unflexibel ist? Und warum sollte die Verwaltung Energie aufwenden, ihre Arbeitsweisen zu ändern, wenn sie eh keine Kompetenzen bekommt? Ich denke, das ist ein Teufelskreis, den es so sehr oft in Unternehmen auf Mikroebene gibt (tpyisches Verhältnis zwischen Angestellten in leitender Funktion und deren Mitarbeiter:innnen). Hier kommen Unternehmenspsycholog:innen ins Spiel und vor allem auch gute Führungskräfte, die eben gezielt diese versteckten Potentiale erkennen müssen. Dann kann auch die Bürokratie sehr zur Effektivität beitragen.', 'Geil! Du hast sie wirklich geschrieben. Und gut ist sie.

Nun freue ich mich dass es Länder mit so hohen Standards gibt.

Here is the whole bit:  President Biden will announce Tuesday that pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. will help make Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot coronavirus vaccine — an unusual pact between fierce competitors that could sharply boost the supply of the newly authorized vaccine, according to senior administration officials.  The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a matter that has not been announced, said they began scouring the country for additional manufacturing capacity after they realized in the first days of the administration that Johnson & Johnson had fallen behind in vaccine production. They soon sought to broker a deal with Merck, one of the world’s largest vaccine makers, which had tried and failed to develop its own coronavirus vaccine.  Under the arrangement, Merck will dedicate two facilities in the United States to Johnson & Johnson’s shots. One will provide “fill-finish” services, the last stage of the production process during which the vaccine substance is placed in vials and packaged for distribution. The other will make the vaccine itself, and has the potential to vastly increase supply, perhaps even doubling what Johnson & Johnson could make on its own, the officials said.  “It’s a historic partnership,” said one of the officials, adding that the companies “recognize this is a wartime effort.” He praised their sense of “corporate citizenship.”  The officials declined to provide details about how Merck’s involvement will affect the projected supply of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and the timetable for distributing it. It could easily take two months to get the “fill-finish” plant ready and a few more months to equip the other facility to make the vaccine, according to a person familiar with the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue.  The Biden administration’s efforts to ramp up production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine suggest that it sees the vaccine playing a bigger role in addressing the challenges ahead, such as the eventual need for children’s vaccine and possibly for boosters to counter virus variants, said a person familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it. Johnson & Johnson is conducting a trial of a two-shot vaccine, with the doses given two months apart, with results not expected until at least May.  Johnson & Johnson did not respond to a request for comment. Merck did not comment on the deal but said it “remains steadfast in our commitment to contribute to the global response to the pandemic.''  The administration officials indicated Biden would wield the powers of the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law, to give Merck priority in securing equipment it will need to upgrade its facilities for vaccine production, including the purchase of machinery, bags, tubing and filtration systems.  In teaming up with Merck, Johnson & Johnson has a partner with a century-long tradition of making vaccines. In the United States, Merck is the sole supplier of the combination childhood vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. It developed Gardasil, which protects against the human papillomavirus. And it won Food and Drug Administration approval for an Ebola vaccine in 2019.  But the company, which makes vaccines in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, encountered setbacks in its own quest to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Merck announced on Jan. 25 that it was halting work on two experimental shots for the virus. The vaccine did not stimulate enough antibodies in Phase 1 human clinical trials to justify continuing, the company said.  Johnson & Johnson has been searching the world for manufacturing sites where it could produce doses of vaccine on a global scale. It has publicly disclosed more than half a dozen manufacturing sites on four continents that it said were winnowed from more than 100 possibilities.  ``While the science and the biology, the chemistry is certainly challenging … the engineering feat of actually producing it is just as challenging, and we’ve been working very, very closely with partners around the world,'' Johnson & Johnson’s CEO Alex Gorsky told CNBC on Monday.  Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine uses an adenovirus vaccine as a vector —- a harmless cold virus that does not replicate in the body — to deliver DNA instructions into a healthy human cell. The cell uses the genetic instructions to create a replica of a coronavirus spike protein that triggers an immune response that can recognize — and respond to — the real thing. The U.S. government paid the company $2 billion for development and clinical trials and preorders at a price of $10 per dose just days after it received emergency authorization from federal regulators.  The FDA on Saturday authorized the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for use in those 18 and older. The company said it would immediately ship nearly 4 million doses in the United States, and a total of 20 million by the end of March, which is 17 million less than expected under its government contract. Its current schedule calls for a recovery from those delays, with the company saying it is on track to deliver 100 million doses by the end of June. A top company executive told Congress last week that it has a goal of manufacturing 1 billion doses worldwide by year’s end.  Most of Johnson & Johnson’s partners disclosed to date are contract manufacturing companies, but now it is moving to team with larger drug companies that have seen their own vaccine projects delayed or fizzled.  Sanofi — which had to reboot its clinical trials of a vaccine candidate after early stumbles — announced last week that it would help Johnson & Johnson with final production steps and bottling in vials in Europe. Projected capacity from a Sanofi plant in France is 12 million doses per month.  BioNTech, Pfizer’s German partner on its mRNA vaccine, also announced deals in January for rivals Sanofi and Novartis to fill and finish vaccine vials in Europe.  The manufacturing process is time-consuming: The company ferments large batches of its vaccine in vats at a contract manufacturing facility in Baltimore operated by Emergent, as well as locations in the Netherlands and India. That brewing step takes two months.  Then the vaccine needs to be put into its final formulation and packaged into vials for shipping, which takes another five to six weeks, including testing for purity. In the United States and Europe, that final ``fill-finish’’ process for vaccines has created bottlenecks across the industry as manufacturers have flooded the supply chain with demand to finish hundreds of millions of doses.  Johnson & Johnson has agreements for fill-finish work to be done by two companies in the United States: Grand River Aseptic, with plants in Michigan, and Catalent, at a plant in Indiana. Catalent also is performing fill-finish operations for Moderna, which is obligated to deliver 300 million doses of its mRNA vaccine to the government by the end of July.  In Italy, Catalent also is helping Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca manufacture vaccine.  Moderna said on Feb. 16 that Catalent had suffered short-term delays on final production of Moderna’s vaccine but that the disruptions would not affect monthly deliveries to the U.S. government. The Financial Times reported on Saturday that Catalent’s system for automatic visual inspection of Johnson & Johnson vials had broken down, forcing staff to inspect vials manually.  Catalent did not respond to a request for comment. The company told investors in an earnings call last month that it had sufficient, dedicated capacity at its Bloomington, Ind., plant to handle the vaccine volume for both companies.  Merck’s help in making Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine probably will require it to examine its product lines and decide what can be delayed or shifted, said John Grabenstein, a consultant and former executive director of medical affairs for vaccines at Merck.  ``The question is, where is the bottleneck? The filling machines and the packaging machines are often the rate-limiting step,’’ he said. From a technical standpoint, it’s not too hard for other companies to help out, he said.  ``It’s not just a mechanical engineering problem. It’s what products might get displaced to do this extra work,’’ he said. ``Is there idle equipment? Oftentimes there isn’t.’’  Merck continues working on a pair of coronavirus treatments. One is an antiviral pill it is developing with a small company called Ridgeback Bio. It purchased worldwide rights to the drug last year from Ridgeback and has entered a late-phase clinical trial in an ongoing collaboration.  The other experimental Merck drug is an anti-inflammatory protein that it received as part of the purchase last year of a smaller company, OncoImmune. The treatment is being tested in a Phase 3 trial. Merck signed a $356 million agreement with the U.S. government in December to manufacture up to 100,000 doses that will be ready to ship in case the drug wins FDA authorization this year."", 'I have never cried after reading an article, but I did after this.

I can’t wait to take him to the zoo, the aquariums and to the botanic gardens in my city.  Please please please everyone get the vaccine when you can or it’s available.

This assumes he knew where the graves were and could travel to states like Lemoyne or New Hanover without something like intervention from law enforcement.

His gripping writing is only made better by your fantastic characterization and acting. Thank you so, so much for bringing this wonderfully written character to life.  I want to know, is Dutch\'s yammering about faith and trust and loyalty a result of narcissism and egotism, or does it stem from self-doubt? Dutch strikes me as a character whose failure to believe in himself is what causes him to demand others to believe in him in his stead.

His line about the police having to ""find another monster to justify their wages"" in particular stuck with me, that whole speech on the cliff was an incredible moment.  I just wanted to ask, what do you think was going through Dutch\'s head when he shot Micah on top of the mountain and left John with the money? Dutch doesn\'t say much but you can tell by the look on his (your) face he must be having a lot of complex emotions at that point.

I've always thought this was one of the most fascinating exchanges throughout the entire game, as it applies to so many of the characters, Dutch especially. Sadie and Charles, who only knew Dutch for a short time, believe he snapped and something changed, while Arthur and John seem to believe he was *always* a bad guy and the gang were just deluding themselves into thinking otherwise.   Ben, do you believe that Dutch was once a good man with fundamentally good intentions who lost his way at the end (due to toxic influences like Micah and the inevitability of civilization's advance) or was all of his moral grandstanding about fighting for freedom and social justice nothing but rhetoric he used to justify robbing and killing as an outlaw?"", ""Hi, Ben. Thank you for participating in this AMA, and thank you for your riveting performance of one of the most complex characters in modern storytelling.

Of course, the problem here is that Trump Org is doing everything in it\'s power to conceal all documents related to Trump Org\'s finances from the American people, and these loans in particular. So threatening litigation that would require exposure of the documents is very difficult to take seriously.  ---  [The relevant clip](https://twitter.com/ScottMStedman/status/1166535318369161223).  >The source says that Deutsche Bank is in possession of loan documents that show Donald Trump has obtained loans with co-signers, and that he would not have been able to obtain loans without cosigners. The source says that the cosigners...are Russian billionaires close to Vladimir Putin.  First, a word of caution:   - This is a **single source** inside Deutsche Bank.    - That source has not been vetted by anyone other than O\'Donnell\'s team at MSNBC.    - If loans co-signed by oligarchs actually exist, the FBI has known about them for a while, certainly since [Mueller subpoenaed DB](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-deutsche-bank-records-subpoenaed-by-mueller-1512480154) in December 2017. It\'s difficult to understand how it would be appropriate to conclude the Mueller investigation without some explication of these relationships.     - It\'s too perfect.

I know no banks—because of the recession, the Great Recession—have touched a golf course. You know, no one’s funding any kind of golf construction. It’s dead in the water the last four or five years.’ And this is what he said. He said, ‘Well, we don’t rely on American banks. **We have all the funding we need out of Russia.’** I said, ‘Really?’ And he said, ‘Oh, yeah. We’ve got some guys that really, really love golf, and they’re really invested in our programs. We just go there all the time.’   - *Deutsche Bank\'s Freakout When Trump wins Election* - Right before the election, Trump was predictably having a hard time with the scottish golf courses (which were [objectively awful](https://www.newyorker.com/news/swamp-chronicles/where-did-donald-trump-get-200-million-dollars-to-buy-his-money-losing-scottish-golf-club) investments that continue to [lose money](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-scotland-golf-courses-inflating-value_n_5d5c1ccce4b05f62fbd5f559)) and needed a bailout. This is when Deutsche Bank appears to have finally realized the gravity of the situation, and [denied his loan request](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/business/trump-deutsche-bank.html), even though it was to just be an extension of loans for his (at the time, profitable) Doral property. Then when he actually won and Russia\'s election assistance was revealed, they [raced to unload  a considerable $600 million](https://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-bank-in-late-2016-raced-to-shed-loan-it-made-to-russian-bank-vtb-11549147289) loan to VTB ([the originally planned financier for Trump Tower Moscow](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/29/events-that-lead-trumps-abandoned-moscow-deal-michael-cohens-latest-plea-agreement/?utm_term=.f3cd69a4f320)). The loan had no documented purpose in DB\'s records.   - *Trump\'s Subordination to Putin: ""Sistema""* - There is some explanation for why Trump\'s sycophancy towards Vladimir Putin, [most egregiously in Helsinki last year](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44852812). There is some explanation for why he [insists on periodic, private meetings where he destroys all records](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/politics/trump-putin-meetings.html) of what was discussed afterwards. Nervousness over conspiracy in the election was always a plausible explanation, but never the most likely. More plausible is simply that Trump unwittingly [bumbled himself into becoming part of the Russian ""Sistema""](https://www.newyorker.com/news/swamp-chronicles/a-theory-of-trump-kompromat), the structure by which Russian oligarchs are forced to stay in line (and subservient to Putin) because they all understand thay they have mutually benefited from criminal activity, and can be destroyed by it\'s exposure. As described by the New Yorker\'s Adam Davidson in *A Theory of Trump Kompromat*:  >Each actor in *sistema* faces near-constant uncertainty about his status, aware that others could well destroy him. Each actor also knows how to use kompromat to destroy rivals but fears that using such material might provoke an explosive response. While each person in sistema feels near-constant uncertainty, the over-all *sistema* is remarkably robust. Kompromat is most powerful when it isn’t used, and when its targets aren’t quite clear about how much destructive information there is out there. If everyone sees potential land mines everywhere, it dramatically increases the price for anybody stepping out of line.  If Trump aided in Russian money-laundering or bribery, he would be guilty of Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) violations. These are notoriously difficult to prosecute without a paper trail. However, if such a trail exists, it is almost certainly accessible to Vladimir Putin.', 'It’s in plain sight.

Putting something on a screen can limit the magnitude of it and some beings in this mythos trigger madness or terror through their presence alone. I tend to agree with this idea, but I think it could maybe be done with an amazing soundtrack and amazing cgi or practical effects.

I\'d prefer a smaller-scale but thoughtful production by, say, A24 versus a highly elaborate PG-13 CGI action fest by Universal, for example.  Alex Garland might be a great choice imo. I can see him making *characters* of the short story\'s one-dimensional (but well done for what they are) characters. And handling the action / tension / claustrophobia really well. I think so long as he retained as much creative control over the story as he has on past films, he\'d be likely to succeed in translating it to film regardless of the tone, target audience, or other high-level demands of the studio. I wouldn\'t necessarily *want* a PG13 pulpy setpiece action movie, but based on *Dredd* I think he could deliver. I bet he could explore or expand on the story\'s geneology / eugenic horror themes in a thoughtful character piece ala *Annihilation*. Etc.

I can\'t imagine how hard it would be for him to work for Trump knowing that Trump still won\'t codemn the ideology of the KKK, white supremacists, and nazis.', ""It's amazing that Trump can instantly respond and attack celebrities, businesspeople, Muslims, Democrats, yet he is incapable of attacking Nazi's, white supremacists, and Putin.  Just think about that."", 'Trump was faster to complain and bitch about Merck than he was to condemn and comment on A FUCKING NAZI MARCH AND TERRORIST ATTACK.', 'Just so everyone knows, when people say that Trump is a white supremacist, it\'s events like today and this weekend that are great examples of how people get that thought into their head.  The fact that it took Trump like 48 hours to release a vague condemnation of violence ""from all sides"" and not mention Nazis at all, but 58 minutes to tweet an attack on a black guy resigning from Trump\'s council BECAUSE he wouldn\'t condemn Nazis really just tells the entire story, doesn\'t it? Trump is more willing to attack those standing up for people against Nazism than he is actual fucking Nazis.  So the next time you see someone label trump a white supremacist, just remember that claim is not baseless. It stems from events like this.', ""Trump is toxic and those around him are bailing at every opportunity. He's a 71 year old baby who can't negotiate, lacks the temperament to entertain opposing views, is an overt racist , lazy, low-energy and is mentally deficient in so many ways. No one should be surprised that he would issue such an inane tweet. So many in the GOP were fearful of his tweets that they went along but the more he tweets the crazier he sounds that anyone still with him will ultimately pay a political price."", ""Wow Trump's response to the CEO of Merck resigning is harsher than Trump's response to a white nationalist KILLING a woman and injuring 19 others"", ""So now we can see ourselves that Trump responds to a tweet directly adressing the white supremacist problem in this country, and chooses to ignore that part of the declaration completely, instead going after the person himself and insulting him.    I'm starting to suspect Trump isn't just appeasing his voterbase, he might actually be a white supremacist himself."", '>Trump responded in a tweet, saying now that ""Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President\'s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!""       ""Darling I love you.  I respect you and will never do you wrong. But if you ever leave me I will publicly call you a filthy cocksucking whore.""', ""Did anyone else notice that we haven't been hearing much about the Trump-Russia collusion since the whole North Korea thing began. Along with Donald Trump's bigly threat!"", 'I bet this is one of the things that pressured Trump to further refine his comments about Charlottesville.  He probably considers this guy a peer - unlike most of the rest of us.']"

What. The. Fuck.', 'Nazis march in our city and kill someone: Trump slow to respond and gives generic ""This is bad.""  Merck CEO Resigns: IMMEDIATE Anger from Trump.  This is my fucking surprised face.', ""He seems even more enraged right now than he usually does. He's probably spent the last couple days staring at a TV screen and screaming. Let's hope Bannon eventually finds his way to the top of the list of people he blames for this particular mistake."", ""It's the duty of every patriotic American, and decent human being worldwide, to reject Trump."", 'Think about this. Trump is hounded by every mainstream press outlet including NY Post and Fox that he did not NAME extremists. 48 hours in to the event he STILL has not done it.

He NAMES the black CEO by lashing at him in UNDER ONE HOUR.', 'Future me: ""In 2017, you\'ll be on the same side as a big pharma CEO, Theresa Mays, and Ted Cruz.""  Past me:  ""So, I lose my mind, is what you\'re saying.""', 'Everyone remaining on the council, however, will not have time to lower ""rip-off"" prices, apparently.', 'in the Donald Trump darkest timeline, [even Big Pharma is against him/on **our** side.](https://twitter.com/Merck/status/897065338566791169)', ""I'd love to see the outcome of a 72-hour psych hold for Trump."", ""I never thought I'd see the day where I would be supporting a decision of a pharma CEO, but here we are."", 'Leaving the seat open for German Merck?
